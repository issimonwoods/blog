				"title": "My Micro.blog Non-Wishlist List",
				"content_html": "<p>Last month I posted <a href=\"https://blog.simonwoods.online/2018/12/07/my-microblog-wishlist.html\">my wishlist for Micro.blog</a>, outlining a number of items should they be implemented I feel would make significant contributions to the effort of making substantial improvements across the platform.</p>\n<p>I built this list over time and that included removing items either implemented in that time or those that, upon reflection became less fitting for my list. Below is a list of some of these items, along with some quick thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Android</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perhaps the most forcefully requested feature for Micro.blog at all, at least publicly. More than a few people have disregarded the platform altogether when it becomes obvious just how Apple-centric it is as far as apps are concerned.</li>\n<li>Whilst I do think the platform will grow for the better with official Android support, I continue to believe it is unlikely to such an extent to be irrelevant, at least for now; if a significant portion of my list is implemented the lack of Android will soon become something of a highly visible flaw, <em>especially</em> for a platform founded on the principles of the open, inclusive web.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Windows</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to the above issue with Android, although to a much lesser extent; aside from anything else, the web app is likely to be easier to access in a desktop-class browser. However, an app through which you are given a smooth and clean interface, even with just basic functionality, would be rather impressive on Windows; I say this as a lifetime user of Windows who has rarely seen third-party software worth talking about.</li>\n<li>I wonder if a browser extension &ndash; at least for Firefox and Chrome, as well as Safari &ndash; would help a decent number of people for whom a Windows app would be appealing, at least in the short term.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Replies on hosted blog posts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This has been requested on more than a few occasions, especially from those for who the stated goals of Micro.blog are particularly attractive &ndash; for people to blog more/get back to blogging, something of a return to the old pre-social behemoth web, etc. Whilst I agree this would be a great feature, I do not believe it is important at a fundamental level for enough people to justify its theoretical status as a priority.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Metrics.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This includes direct access to your Following list in a way with which most people are familiar thanks to the increasingly homogenic design of mainstream social media, the very presence of public <em>Likes</em> and/or <em>Reactions</em>, and through to the likes of built-in stats for posts. Not only do I think this would muddle the main message through which Micro.blog is promoted, I have yet to be convinced that the presence of such features ever contribute to the net positive of platforms through which people seek to <em>discuss</em> ideas and matters at hand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Search.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Global search built right into Micro.blog.

				"content_text": "Last month I posted [my wishlist for Micro.blog](https://blog.simonwoods.online/2018/12/07/my-microblog-wishlist.html), outlining a number of items should they be implemented I feel would make significant contributions to the effort of making substantial improvements across the platform.\n\nI built this list over time and that included removing items either implemented in that time or those that, upon reflection became less fitting for my list. Below is a list of some of these items, along with some quick thoughts:\n\n- Android\n\t- Perhaps the most forcefully requested feature for Micro.blog at all, at least publicly. More than a few people have disregarded the platform altogether when it becomes obvious just how Apple-centric it is as far as apps are concerned. \n\t- Whilst I do think the platform will grow for the better with official Android support, I continue to believe it is unlikely to such an extent to be irrelevant, at least for now; if a significant portion of my list is implemented the lack of Android will soon become something of a highly visible flaw, _especially_ for a platform founded on the principles of the open, inclusive web.\n\n- Windows\n\t- Similar to the above issue with Android, although to a much lesser extent; aside from anything else, the web app is likely to be easier to access in a desktop-class browser. However, an app through which you are given a smooth and clean interface, even with just basic functionality, would be rather impressive on Windows; I say this as a lifetime user of Windows who has rarely seen third-party software worth talking about.\n\t- I wonder if a browser extension -- at least for Firefox and Chrome, as well as Safari -- would help a decent number of people for whom a Windows app would be appealing, at least in the short term.\n\n- Replies on hosted blog posts.\n\t- This has been requested on more than a few occasions, especially from those for who the stated goals of Micro.blog are particularly attractive -- for people to blog more/get back to blogging, something of a return to the old pre-social behemoth web, etc. Whilst I agree this would be a great feature, I do not believe it is important at a fundamental level for enough people to justify its theoretical status as a priority.\n\t\n- Metrics.\n\t- This includes direct access to your Following list in a way with which most people are familiar thanks to the increasingly homogenic design of mainstream social media, the very presence of public _Likes_ and/or _Reactions_, and through to the likes of built-in stats for posts. Not only do I think this would muddle the main message through which Micro.blog is promoted, I have yet to be convinced that the presence of such features ever contribute to the net positive of platforms through which people seek to _discuss_ ideas and matters at hand. \n\n- Search.\n\t- Global search built right into Micro.blog. This will _immediately solve \"Discovery\"_ or so it would seem when people react with shock at the lack of conventional search. Not only does the hosted search feature provide a practical option for those who are aligned with the philosophy behind Micro.blog (i.e. bloggers, including those who are more concerned with writing and posting than they are fiddling with technical toys) but the search available via Discover provides search within a focused context. For the moment that is more than enough.\n\n- 'Show More' everywhere (replies especially).\n\t- I totally forgot about this. It is an example of feature parity, or lack thereof and whilst I would dearly love to see it (hi from Windows and Android üëãüèª) it's definitely not a deal-breaker nor a thing I believe would turn many people away, at least not in the short term.\n\nI am confident there are plenty of other items I could have put here, however those are the ones I have noticed when it comes to looking at both the platform and community as a whole. It'll be interesting to see if any of these make progress ahead of my actual wishlist.\n",

(I am unashamedly biased towards this, heh.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Help;\n<ul>\n<li>Add search. This has been mitigated by the recently improved homepage but over time a search box will become necessary for most people.</li>\n<li>Further additions from other sources &ndash; ex: <a href=\"http://www.manton.org/2017/10/micro-blog-special-pins.html\">this &lsquo;pins&rsquo; post from Manton</a> &ndash; which has already happened a little.</li>\n<li>Make sure the breadth of blog-centred web is covered.</li>\n<li>For example: self-hosted WordPress, hosted WP, multisite WP, shared hosting WP.</li>\n<li>WP has the potential to lack compatibility due to different hosts implementing their own version for whatever reason.</li>\n<li>Micro.blog should, even if gradually, cover more and more of this ground until everything is up-to-date and quickly updated whenever different versions of WP are updated.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Broadly;\n<ul>\n<li>Where possible, all of these updates should be available to third-party apps.</li>\n<li>The web MUST be the canonical version. App-centric approaches are in direct opposition to any substantial support of the open web, <em>especially</em> when they are Apple-only efforts, mostly due to the cost barrier.</li>\n<li>This year has seen <em>a lot</em> of improvements to the web app, which is great! Long may it continue.</li>\n<li><em>Example of Apple-centric approach</em>: the Micro.blog home page for logged-out visitors has a screenshot of the Mac App.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There might be things I&rsquo;m missing but there is one glaring omission; Android. I have mentioned the Apple-heavy support of Micro.blog but not listed Android, or any other platform. The reality is an official Android app is all but impossible in the current circumstances, whilst third-party efforts are ongoing but appear to be particularly difficult to implement; this is of course not at all exclusive to Micro.blog but remains a fact even so.</p>\n<p>Windows and even Linux support have also been spoken about by developers but for now the web is the answer for those of us outside of Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem, and I believe some of the items on my list would further soften the blow that is a lack of cross-native app support.</p>\n<p>‚Ä¢  ‚Ä¢  ‚Ä¢</p>\n<p>Micro.blog recently hit <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2018/12/03/microblog-milestone-first.html\">the first year of public release</a> and it is fair to say it has come a <em>long</em> way in those 12 months, let alone the progress Manton has made from the earliest days of the Kickstarter project. I for one have found <em>just</em> the right place for my life online, to such an extent that I now begrudgingly use the mainstream silos of the web for work and do everything I can to avoid them in a personal context. For that reason and that reason alone I have spent plenty of my time on <a href=\"https://micro.blog/simonwoods\">the timeline</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.simonwoods.online\">my hosted site</a>, <a href=\"https://photos.simonwoods.online\">my new photoblog</a>, and <a href=\"https://micro.blog/til\">Today I Learned</a>.</p>\n<p>And, like Micro.blog itself, I&rsquo;m just getting started.</p>\n<p>What do you think?

Links: [Quick list](https://blog.simonwoods.online/2018/04/18/quick-microblog-wishlist.html); [Needs](https://blog.simonwoods.online/2018/08/31/what-microblog-needs.html); [Thoughts](https://blog.simonwoods.online/2018/09/23/microblog-thoughts-thereon.html))\n\n- Comprehensive support of features centred around accessibility;\n  - Easier `alt` tags, VoiceOver support, and a robust editor are some of the necessary pieces to making Micro.blog as accessible as possible. \n  - Some improvements were recently made on iOS.\n- Thorough user moderation;\n  - The ability to control as much of your timeline as possible is essential to making Micro.blog a viable space in which people can comfortably invest their time and energy.\n  - Earlier this year the web and Mac apps gained muting and reporting tools.\n- Multi-account support on the web.\n- Keyboard shortcuts;\n  - _ctrl+enter to post_, etc. The lack of these options on the web is jarring, especially in a post editor.\n- Mentions;\n  - When replying in a thread, you ought to be given the option to reply-all or not.\n  - Autofill when typing a username.\n  - Autofill has come to iOS, when creating new posts.\n- Editing replies;\n  - Even if there was a limit applied via time and/or length.\n- Conversations;\n  - Some form of threaded replies is needed.\n  - Links to replies go to the actual reply.\n- Better responsive design;\n  - On the web it should be possible to make the browser window smaller without cutting off parts of the site.\n- Dark mode.\n- humans.txt;\n  - An option to set this as a special page aligns perfectly with the web-centred philosophy around which Micro.blog was built.\n- IndieWeb support;\n  - Like\n  - Repost\n  - Selected entry (for quoting)\n  - Emoji link share -- this is available in Omnibear, as a custom alternative to _Like_.\n  - IndieWeb support has improved greatly throughout the year.\n- Feedback;\n  - When taking an action there should be better, more obvious feedback from the site.\n  - For example; taking you to your reply once it has been posted.\n  - This has improved throughout the year.\n- Cross-posting per post;\n  - A version of this exists on iOS.\n- Hosted;\n  - Theme editing -- some way to connect owner of blog to theme controls when they are browsing the site.\n  - Improve performance of saving changes to pages, posts, and the theme.\n  - Drafts -- the 'Preview' feature is good but the ability to temporarily save posts would be fantastic.\n  - Greater variety of payment plans.\n  - Either an expanded trial or limited posting ability for free accounts.\n  - A free _test blog_ on which you can preview changes to pages and themes, and send out posts but they never make it to the timeline.\n  - Discounted bulk blog subscriptions. (I am unashamedly biased towards this, heh.)\n- Help;\n  - Add search. This has been mitigated by the recently improved homepage but over time a search box will become necessary for most people.\n  - Further additions from other sources -- ex: [this 'pins' post from Manton](http://www.manton.org/2017/10/micro-blog-special-pins.html) -- which has already happened a little.\n  - Make sure the breadth of blog-centred web is covered.\n  - For example: self-hosted WordPress, hosted WP, multisite WP, shared hosting WP.\n  - WP has the potential to lack compatibility due to different hosts implementing their own version for whatever reason.\n  - Micro.blog should, even if gradually, cover more and more of this ground until everything is up-to-date and quickly updated whenever different versions of WP are updated.\n- Broadly;\n  - Where possible, all of these updates should be available to third-party apps.\n  - The web MUST be the canonical version. App-centric approaches are in direct opposition to any substantial support of the open web, _especially_ when they are Apple-only efforts, mostly due to the cost barrier.\n  - This year has seen _a lot_ of improvements to the web app, which is great! Long may it continue.\n  - _Example of Apple-centric approach_: the Micro.blog home page for logged-out visitors has a screenshot of the Mac App.\n\nThere might be things I'm missing but there is one glaring omission; Android. I have mentioned the Apple-heavy support of Micro.blog but not listed Android, or any other platform. The reality is an official Android app is all but impossible in the current circumstances, whilst third-party efforts are ongoing but appear to be particularly difficult to implement; this is of course not at all exclusive to Micro.blog but remains a fact even so.\n\nWindows and even Linux support have also been spoken about by developers but for now the web is the answer for those of us outside of Apple's ecosystem, and I believe some of the items on my list would further soften the blow that is a lack of cross-native app support.\n\n ‚Ä¢  ‚Ä¢  ‚Ä¢\n\nMicro.blog recently hit [the first year of public release](https://www.manton.org/2018/12/03/microblog-milestone-first.html) and it is fair to say it has come a _long_ way in those 12 months, let alone the progress Manton has made from the earliest days of the Kickstarter project. I for one have found _just_ the right place for my life online, to such an extent that I now begrudgingly use the mainstream silos of the web for work and do everything I can to avoid them in a personal context. For that reason and that reason alone I have spent plenty of my time on [the timeline](https://micro.blog/simonwoods), [my hosted site](https://blog.simonwoods.online), [my new photoblog](https://photos.simonwoods.online), and [Today I Learned](https://micro.blog/til).\n\nAnd, like Micro.blog itself, I'm just getting started.\n\nWhat do you think?

Too much negative momentum has built up over time and making as many steps into cross-platform waters as they can will likely help negate that momentum, even if only as a starting point in the effort to do so.\n",

He also likes to use words incorrectly, if for nothing else than the exquisite joy of seeing people care enough to get annoyed about it. There‚Äôs also a chance that doing the ‚Äòwords‚Äô thing is difficult and laziness feels so damned good. He‚Äôs lucky enough to live with Claire Field, an infinitely patient and dizzyingly talented fianc√©e, in a city that is known for a collection of insects who continue to be quite popular many years after their death. Every day is made even better by the company of two cats, one of a delicate nature and the other of a kind you are likely to see with the Muppets.</p>\n<p>The effort to work is often characterised by an inability to make substantial progress one way or the other but Simon has at least improved his ability to recognise this in a practical manner. There are points when it seems best to give up but then life wouldn‚Äôt be very interesting without challenges, and so he perseveres. To this day it is likely his most impressive achievement.</p>\n<p>For those who have taken the time to read this he apologises. Please know that it was excruciating to write.</p>\n<p>Especially the three paragraphs before this one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&hellip; I was, uh, trying something. If it taught me one thing it&rsquo;s that I much prefer to write creatively within the context of specific projects, especially when it comes to writing fiction.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m still thinking a lot about my pages and my blog and how it all fits together; I&rsquo;m leaning towards having a single page as a better representation for both what I am now doing <em>and</em> what I am aiming to do. The question now is: how do I create such a page?</p>\n<p>I have a custom domain &ndash; whilst I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;d like to thank <a href=\"https://manton.org\">Manton</a> for introducing me to the idea that as long as you have your domain, the guts of the site are largely irrelevant; it has clarified my thinking <em>a whole fucking lot</em> &ndash; so I think I&rsquo;ll start with something that&rsquo;s free and then upgrade later when possible, should there be something else I need from such a site.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I have tweaked both my <a href=\"http://simonmumbles.micro.blog/about/\">current About page</a> and <a href=\"http://simonmumbles.micro.blog/feeds/\">my Subscribe page</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, I just <a href=\"http://til.micro.blog/2018/11/23/updates-recent.html\">released a bunch of updates</a> for <a href=\"https://micro.blog/til\">@til</a> and now I&rsquo;m ready to ramp up my efforts on other projects.

				"content_text": "This is a previous version of my _About_ page on my hosted Micro.blog site:\n\n> Simon Woods is a man of dubious taste with little to no skill for effectively managing time, space, or any other dimension. He also likes to use words incorrectly, if for nothing else than the exquisite joy of seeing people care enough to get annoyed about it. There‚Äôs also a chance that doing the ‚Äòwords‚Äô thing is difficult and laziness feels so damned good. He‚Äôs lucky enough to live with Claire Field, an infinitely patient and dizzyingly talented fianc√©e, in a city that is known for a collection of insects who continue to be quite popular many years after their death. Every day is made even better by the company of two cats, one of a delicate nature and the other of a kind you are likely to see with the Muppets.\n>\n> The effort to work is often characterised by an inability to make substantial progress one way or the other but Simon has at least improved his ability to recognise this in a practical manner. There are points when it seems best to give up but then life wouldn‚Äôt be very interesting without challenges, and so he perseveres. To this day it is likely his most impressive achievement.\n>\n> For those who have taken the time to read this he apologises. Please know that it was excruciating to write.\n>\n> Especially the three paragraphs before this one.\n\n... I was, uh, trying something. If it taught me one thing it's that I much prefer to write creatively within the context of specific projects, especially when it comes to writing fiction.\n\nI'm still thinking a lot about my pages and my blog and how it all fits together; I'm leaning towards having a single page as a better representation for both what I am now doing _and_ what I am aiming to do. The question now is: how do I create such a page?\n\nI have a custom domain -- whilst I'm here, I'd like to thank [Manton](https://manton.org) for introducing me to the idea that as long as you have your domain, the guts of the site are largely irrelevant; it has clarified my thinking _a whole fucking lot_ -- so I think I'll start with something that's free and then upgrade later when possible, should there be something else I need from such a site.\n\nAnyway, I have tweaked both my [current About page](http://simonmumbles.micro.blog/about/) and [my Subscribe page](http://simonmumbles.micro.blog/feeds/).\n\nAlso, I just [released a bunch of updates](http://til.micro.blog/2018/11/23/updates-recent.html) for [@til](https://micro.blog/til) and now I'm ready to ramp up my efforts on other projects. As I [previously mentioned](https://simonmumbles.micro.blog/2018/10/14/autumn-falls.html) my blogging quantity will decrease but in place of that I will produce higher quality, focused work. My ability to do this has in fact been jump-started by my renewed blogging over the past year, which is another thing for which I can thank Manton Reece; seriously dude, you both got more blogging from me _and_ helped me find the focus required to make hard decisions... for that, I can't thank you enough.\n\nThere are times when it becomes easy to forget the things we do for each other as people.

I'll talk more about this soon but for now, here are the changes:\n\n- Considered Haste -- the previous version of my website -- has now merged into this site.\n  - The name _Mumblings_ remains.\n- Now page is updated.\n- Feeds page has been added.\n- Considered Haste archive imported.\n\t- sorry for any duplicate posts; they should be far back, though.\n- Most recent Mumblings' posts imported from WordPress.\n- Uh... that's it!\n  - honestly, the Now pages covers some stuff\n\nI'm looking forward to posting some more about what's happening here within the context of Micro.blog in general. Despite not having access to regular posting, I have very much been reading and seeing the continued progress of Micro.blog and, uh, latest events in the Closed Web.\n\nIt's good to be back. ‚úåÔ∏è\n",

Basically: life away from the keyboard demands every penny that can be spared and ultimately that will make my full and proper return to blogging a <em>lot</em> easier. Other subscriptions were cancelled but that's a story for another time. For now, here's what is happening:\n\n<ul>\n    <li><em>Mumblings</em> is now a WordPress Hosted site, with its feed plugged into my Micro.blog account.</li>\n    <li><em>Considered Haste</em> remains as an archive.</li>\n    <li>Updates will now be posted on here, rather than as edits to the most recent post on <em>Considered Haste</em>.</li>\n    <li>This site will stay in its current condition.\n<ul>\n    <li>WordPress Hosted is inferior in a number of ways to a (paid) Micro.blog Hosted site, specifically in the areas of customisation. As such there's no point trying to recreate <a href=\"https://simonmumbles.micro.blog\">the proper version of Mumblings</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n    <li>I've dropped Twitter entirely. My recent posts on the matter continue to reflect my position, although I have come to the conclusion it is not a thing I want in my personal life at all.\n<ul>\n    <li>Good luck to those who continue to make the choice to include it, though I would also suggest you at least take a look at Micro.blog and/or my current set-up as an alternative: free WordPress + free Micro.blog.\n<ul>\n    <li>RSS is awesome! Emails, newsletters, and Slack can also help switch out the cesspool for, you know, your¬†<em>health</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n    <li>Other than VSCO and Vimeo, I am generally done with non-self hosted platforms. And I prefer both of those for their <em>specialist</em> use anyway, something more akin to enthusiast use as compared to my personal use of Micro.blog.</li>\n    <li>Recent real life events have thoroughly kicked my arse when it comes to progress on my projects. However, things are working out well and so I will soon have¬†<em>actual news</em> and¬†<em>actual activity</em> from more than one project.</li>\n    <li>For personal stuff, well, my current faves are: a new powered wheelchair for Claire (yay freedom!) and an addition to our back door in the form of a kitty door; that's right, cat flap installed!\n<ul>\n    <li>Other things happened, some of which I'll probably soon detail on here.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nSo yeah, lots of things happening and the thing I am most happy with is the return to blogging.

It feels good to be surprised by progress. üòä\n",
