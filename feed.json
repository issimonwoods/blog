I spend plenty of time with my iPad or Pixel and don't have even one tenth the level of stress-induced headaches as I do with Microsoft's software.\n\nNow on my to-do list:\n\n1. Move relevant tech back to Google stuff; I have a fucking Pixel so why I am bothering with other big vendors is now beyond me.\n2. Get Dropbox set up again; they and Backblaze are the only palatable major third-party developers with whom I have been satisfied with regard to these large file-based tasks.\n3.

Just like that. More than seven years of my non-job life no longer evident in full public view.</p>\n\n<p>It was strange, not least since things had become steadily worse leading up to this event and so in some ways I had already come to terms with the situation, although to this day I still regret that the project is gone and can never come back. There was a lot in that project, a website centred around creativity and community, that had taken me from my last typical day job through the chaotic first years of becoming a full-time carer. And now it was gone.</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say I had a <em>lot</em> of energy and time now at my disposal, especially once I had taken a good two-week break to recover from such a significant event, and the first thing to come to mind was settling a question that had come often to my thoughts in the preceding years;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How can I just write?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have written across different subjects in different ways onto different places across the web for a number of years, so much so that it feels odd to think of a time before I did it.

Brewster Kahle wrote this in February but it has become even more relevant with each passing day. We shouldn&rsquo;t forget those who built the frameworks of our digital world, not when they&rsquo;re still talking about it today.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dori.micro.blog/2018/12/01/one-of-the.html\">Frustrations at the IndyWeb conference</a>. Dori Smith thinks those involved with the IndieWeb ought to reach out to Tumblr users in particular, and it makes perfect sense. Up until the past few years Tumblr remained unique within the silos as it continued to embrace blogs, RSS, and the like.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2018/12/03/microblog-milestone-first.html\">Micro.blog milestone: first year open to the public</a>. Manton Reece has maintained and continuously improved the various aspects of the platform, whilst the community has proven that you do <em>not</em> need to have your hand held by a closed, hostile system to have an online life.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.patrickrhone.net/algorithms-dont-see/\">Algorithms Don&rsquo;t See</a>. Speaking of the Micro.blog community, Patrick Rhone is a frequent contributor with gems such as this piece in which he succinctly underlines why an inhuman approach to curating the web is simply not good enough.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw/status/1053648947007361024\">The web in 2018</a> (<a href=\"https://imgur.com/EoNd3ev\">original link</a>) is a brilliant gif shared by Andy Bell. Website UX being sacrificed for cheap ad rates and lazy marketing has clearly been no solution at all to the challenges of the modern web.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://annie.micro.blog/2018/11/04/i-have-a.html\">A Small Hymn in Praise of My Body</a>. Annie Mueller is another member of the Micro.blog community, and yet another person whose words are worthy of reading by anybody. This post has taken residence in my mind and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be going anywhere for some time yet.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://micro.inessential.com/2018/12/03/why-write-about.html\">Why write about lunch?</a> Why yes, Brent Simmons <em>is</em> on Micro.blog. Huh, funny that! In this short posts he hits a number of great points in answering the stated question.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gabytron.me/2018/12/04/are-there-any.html\">Are there any rules?</a> Another great question from yet another member of the Micro.blog community. Luis Gabriel Santiago Alvarado has gradually returned to blogging over the past year and with posts like this it&rsquo;s easy to see why. <a href=\"https://micro.blog/Gaby/1265974\">You can answer his question, if you like</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.restlesslens.me/2018/12/07/working-around-the.html\">Pretty Damn Futuristic</a>.

Speaking of Brad, he is building a directory of his own to which you can link or even add its search to your site.

Mandaris Moore is doing a great thing for the holiday season, with yet another brilliant contribution to the Micro.blog community. You <a href=\"https://micro.blog/mandaris/1222550\">can talk to him about it on Micro.blog</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/g0rmyr/status/1068986379118497794\">Critters Unplugged</a> is a phenomenal gathering of Critical Role cosplayers.

				"content_text": "A few things for you:\n\n- [Big Data versus Humanity](http://brewster.kahle.org/2018/02/25/big-data-versus-humanity/). Brewster Kahle wrote this in February but it has become even more relevant with each passing day. We shouldn't forget those who built the frameworks of our digital world, not when they're still talking about it today.\n- [Frustrations at the IndyWeb conference](https://dori.micro.blog/2018/12/01/one-of-the.html). Dori Smith thinks those involved with the IndieWeb ought to reach out to Tumblr users in particular, and it makes perfect sense. Up until the past few years Tumblr remained unique within the silos as it continued to embrace blogs, RSS, and the like.\n- [Micro.blog milestone: first year open to the public](https://www.manton.org/2018/12/03/microblog-milestone-first.html). Manton Reece has maintained and continuously improved the various aspects of the platform, whilst the community has proven that you do _not_ need to have your hand held by a closed, hostile system to have an online life. \n- [Algorithms Don't See](https://www.patrickrhone.net/algorithms-dont-see/). Speaking of the Micro.blog community, Patrick Rhone is a frequent contributor with gems such as this piece in which he succinctly underlines why an inhuman approach to curating the web is simply not good enough.\n- [The web in 2018](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw/status/1053648947007361024) ([original link](https://imgur.com/EoNd3ev)) is a brilliant gif shared by Andy Bell. Website UX being sacrificed for cheap ad rates and lazy marketing has clearly been no solution at all to the challenges of the modern web.\n- [A Small Hymn in Praise of My Body](https://annie.micro.blog/2018/11/04/i-have-a.html). Annie Mueller is another member of the Micro.blog community, and yet another person whose words are worthy of reading by anybody. This post has taken residence in my mind and I don't think it'll be going anywhere for some time yet.\n- [Why write about lunch?](https://micro.inessential.com/2018/12/03/why-write-about.html) Why yes, Brent Simmons _is_ on Micro.blog. Huh, funny that! In this short posts he hits a number of great points in answering the stated question.\n- [Are there any rules?](https://gabytron.me/2018/12/04/are-there-any.html) Another great question from yet another member of the Micro.blog community. Luis Gabriel Santiago Alvarado has gradually returned to blogging over the past year and with posts like this it's easy to see why. [You can answer his question, if you like](https://micro.blog/Gaby/1265974).\n- [Pretty Damn Futuristic](https://www.restlesslens.me/2018/12/07/working-around-the.html). Jeremy has found, like me, AirPods to be pretty damn good. _Especially_ when used within the Apple ecosystem.\n- [Randall Munroe's excellent comic immediately came to mind](https://xkcd.com/1361/) the moment I came across the latest news about Google Hangouts and Allo.\n- [The True Size](https://thetruesize.com) is an excellent web app to help you keep check of your mental model of the world, made by James Talmage and Damon Maneice who were in turn inspired by _The West Wing_ which in itself is often a very good thing indeed.\n  - [h/t Chad Moore](https://micro.blog/cm/1283349)\n- [Populism and Today's Social Tech vs. Blogging](https://ramblinggit.com/2018/11/populism-and-todays-social-tech-vs-blogging/). Brad Enslen is hitting out of the park again with his thinking on the web, starting with this first part of a series.\n- [Indieseek Directory](https://indieseek.xyz/links/index.php?TID=pages-linktous). Speaking of Brad, he is building a directory of his own to which you can link or even add its search to your site. Efforts like this are how we rebuild the web and move it away from the centralised, silo behemoths.\n- [MetPublications](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/titles-with-full-text-online) is the archive created by The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, with which you can access decades worth of publications on art history __for free__.\n- [Advent Calendar of Compliments](https://mandaris.micro.blog/2018/12/01/going-to-give.html). Mandaris Moore is doing a great thing for the holiday season, with yet another brilliant contribution to the Micro.blog community. You [can talk to him about it on Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/mandaris/1222550)! \n- [Critters Unplugged](https://twitter.com/g0rmyr/status/1068986379118497794) is a phenomenal gathering of Critical Role cosplayers. Just look at all of that colour. üòç\n- [A teacher welcomes her students into the classroom in the best way possible](https://twitter.com/MuslimIQ/status/1062381120766033921). I both love this idea and will 100% steal it.\n- [NEW. CRITICAL. ROLE. INTRO.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz2o_bVkgPA)\n- [NEW. DRAGON. AGE. TRAILER.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw3lrXlti-8&t=0s)\n- [NEW. AVENGERS. TRAILER.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA6hldpSTF8)\n- [PUSHEEN. CHRISTMAS.](http://pusheen.com/post/180685163471)\n\nEnjoy your weekend!\n",

There is no entry-level model; this is simply not something Apple are interested in offering to people.\n\nSo if I run into [similar problems to that which Kohan Ikin has experienced](https://twitter.com/syneryder/status/1066258885923635200) I'll be pretty well screwed. After saving for a computer for months and then relying on it to get work done, they would basically have me by the balls and only create _more_ stress of a kind that is damaging in different ways.\n\n\"Just use what you've got\" or \"Just get another computer\" you might say; right, fair enough, but I am already using what I have got -- which, don't get me wrong, is quite good -- and the fact is that I am talking about my _livelihood_ here, not just something to fart around on with the browser and email and shitty games or something. The change to the Mac might not actually work; it might be the case that I prefer Windows but even then just to _try_ the Mac there is still this potential for more stress than I am sure I have the capacity with which to deal.\n\nDamn it. Technology needs to hurry up and become better overall and more accessible.\n",

Earlier this year Manton Reece and Jean MacDonald spoke about Micro.blog at the IndieWeb Summit. It's a great talk that pairs well [with the recently released intro video](https://help.micro.blog/2018/video-intro/). ‚≠ê\n\nEnjoy your weekend!\n",
