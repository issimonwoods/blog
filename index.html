<p>With the release of the newest set of updates to <a href="https://micro.blog/TIL">@TIL</a>, I am happy to say that the unofficial companion to Micro.blog has entered the next phase of its development.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the release notes for those TL:DR fans out there:</p>

<h3 id="til-1-9">TIL 1.9:</h3>

<ul>
<li>üÜï Banner at <a href="https://til.micro.blog/">the top of the site</a>.

<ul>
<li>(thanks to <a href="https://custom.micro.blog/2019/07/05/add-a-header.html">Miraz</a> via <a href="https://micro.blog/custom">@custom</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>üÜï Button for The Insight Program also at the top.</li>
<li>üÜï Listed Link buttons at the bottom.

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://üï∏üíç.ws">IndieWeb Webring</a> and <a href="https://indieseek.xyz">Indieseek directory</a> are both fantastic examples of the independent web doing what it does best.</li>
<li>Thanks to both <a href="https://micro.blog/schmarty">@schmarty</a> and <a href="https://micro.blog/bradenslen">@bradenslen</a> for their work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>üÜï Emoji prefixes for posts.</li>
<li>Wider pages, larger text, design fixes.</li>
<li><em>Unofficial</em> added to the tagline.</li>
<li>Large parts of <a href="https://til.micro.blog/about">the About page</a> rewritten.</li>
<li>üÜï Banners + avatars, and profile edits; <a href="https://micro.blog/TIL">Micro.blog</a> + <a href="https://twitter.com/til_micro_blog">Twitter</a>.</li>
<li>üÜï Membership <a href="https://til.memberful.com/join">launched on Memberful</a>.</li>
<li>Buy Me A Coffee page <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/simonwoods/moving-memberful">closed</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="unofficial">Unofficial</h2>

<p>One of the updates is for the edits made to include the word <em>unofficial</em> in the TIL tagline. This better reflects the reality of the endeavour; yes I do get help from the team but this is not an official part of Micro.blog at all. It&rsquo;s all just me, making it happen, and as such it&rsquo;s better to make this as obvious as possible.</p>

<p>One of the reasons this is important is cost. As time passes and TIL grows, and as my standards improve &ndash; albeit unsteadily for the past 18 months &ndash; I have reached an inflection point. The project can not remain stable or grow further without money, and whilst I wish I could tell you my recent big home move resulted in an immediate and entirely surprising <em>increase</em> in our income&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be unsurprised that is very much not the case.</p>

<p>As such I have closed the Buy Me A Coffee page and now invite you to take a look at the first membership offering for Today I Learned: <a href="https://til.memberful.com/join">The Insight Program</a>. Right now it is entirely donation-based, with no rewards on offer. As I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine, this is not the plan for the long term; in fact, the very reason I have moved to Memberful is due to the numerous ways in which their platform is so much better made for offering a variety of memberships. This is a start&hellip; I am looking forward to doing more.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice on the Memberful site that I have detailed the costs of TIL, including my fundraising goal for this version of the membership. I am doing everything I can to work around costs; using free trials, renting, finding free versions of software, carefully managing my computer&hellip; just as much as I can think of. I hope my intention here is as transparent as possible; every single penny that is put towards a plan in The Insight Program will be put directly into running Today I Learned.</p>

<p>Here is a quick example of the current situation regarding costs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setapp has expired. Having finished the 7-day trial of the rental service, I had quickly made use of a few apps for TIL.

<ul>
<li>Although, to be honest, the ongoing cost of the subscription is likely not the best choice even if in the short term it could be helpful.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NounPro Unlimited will expire in 3 weeks. The premium subscription for The Noun Project has already been put to use in a number of the design updates you can now see on the site and external profiles.</li>
<li>Sketch trial will expire in 3 weeks. Similar to Noun, only in this instance practically <em>all</em> of the new graphics in use for TIL were made in Sketch.

<ul>
<li>Much like with Setapp, I am unsure if this subscription makes sense in the long run. Though I have a back-up plan, which you can see listed on the Memberful site.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>&hellip; and so I will continued to do my best in this way. Please let me know if you&rsquo;re aware of any comparable free alternatives (MBP High Sierra 13.6), including that which is listed on the Memberful site.</p>

<p>Speaking of costs being covered and the overwhelming generosity of the community, I would like to give a wholehearted thank you to the multiple donors to the Buy Me A Coffee page. You&rsquo;re all just fantastic and have left me flabbergasted, having literally helped my family move and thus massively improve our standard of living. On top of that, just 3 days ago Matt Cassem (<a href="https://micro.blog/sarcassem">@sarcassem</a>) donated enough to cover email hosting for the next 12 months <em>with</em> money to spare that will be put to use in another part of TIL.</p>

<p>Seriously&hellip; overwhelming ‚ò∫Ô∏è</p>

<p>Yes, so, you can help out with either a single donation or a monthly payment. The links to these can be found <a href="https://til.micro.blog/about">on the newly updated About page</a> as well as <a href="https://til.memberful.com/join">the Memberful site itself</a>.</p>

<h2 id="realign">Realign</h2>

<p>Last week I changed the posting schedule for the site, introducing later posts as a result of an unexpected shift in my personal schedule. This may become a permanent change but I can&rsquo;t say for sure. Either way I&rsquo;ll continue to work to make publishing as reliable and consistent as possible.</p>

<p>Post Haste is currently on hold. Between uncertainty regarding email hosting costs and a switch to Fastmail that has been a little complicated regarding Buttondown hosting, there was suddenly something of a hurdle between writing the issues of the newsletter and publishing them. Thanks to the aforementioned good news regarding email hosting and <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/10/11/little-screenshot-of.html">the teaser screenshot posted by Manton last month</a>, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be much longer before ICYMI is back.</p>

<p>Major design updates are now finished for at least the next few months. Version 1.9 means what it implies; the next change for the site, and likely the various extensions that make up TIL, will be 2.0 and all that entails. I have been working on ideas for this and look forward to getting my hands dirty with Hugo in particular. In the meantime I&rsquo;ll make fixes and minor tweaks for smaller updates but as has once been said before: no new features.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was both a lot of fun and quite stressful to put together these changes. In the end it has been the most satisfying update to make, and I hope you&rsquo;ll join me in making this feel like just the beginning.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to building 2.0 but mostly, next, I can already feel the excitement for some new features that will hopefully be out very soon.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll be back with regular activity throughout the week and will see you at the next big announcement.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>‚è§ Simon</p>

         	<p>Earlier today I <a href="https://simonmumbles.micro.blog/2021/09/09/i-hate-to.html">put out a short post to ask for help</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my wife and I have discovered that we will be short of money to cover all of our bills this month, and it is making what is an otherwise life-changing event into an all-too familiar ball of stress, anxiety, and frankly, shame.</p>

<p>With that in mind I&rsquo;m going to step outside of my usual tight-lipped approach and provide a preview of the direct benefit to donating towards my efforts with Today I Learned.</p>

<p>Here are the things <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/simonwoods">your donation</a> can help me make:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Guides:</strong> The existing Guides will be updated, and more importantly a whole new batch will be published over a short period of time. This will relaunch Guides as a regular post type, including special editions in which related Guides are published over the space of a week.</li>
<li>Return to <strong>regular posting</strong>. Everything from before the break &ndash; Tips, Updates, Introducing, Lookup, the recently launched Linked posts, and ICYMI: the weekly catch-up edition of the newsletter &ndash; plus the return of The Macro Report.</li>
<li>The rest of the <strong>special edition of The Macro Report</strong>.</li>
<li>Reactivation of the Twitter account, with which I&rsquo;ll make it easier for people outside of Micro.blog to see just how awesome our community is.</li>
<li>Further <strong>design improvements</strong> to the site and Post Haste (the newsletter).</li>
<li>Brand new regular post types, starting with a <strong>micro-guide that is entirely image-based</strong>.</li>
<li>A new edition of <strong>Post Haste</strong>, built around staying updated with urgent Micro.blog events.</li>
</ul>

<p>&hellip; and more. My plans reach well into the future, with everything built on a steady and sustainable timeline. On <a href="https://til.micro.blog/support/">the Support page</a> I state that I won&rsquo;t make promises, so this feels even more uncomfortable to write.</p>

<p>However, I hope that highlights just how urgent my current needs have become. You wouldn&rsquo;t just be helping my family, you would also be securing the path to Today I Learned 2.0. üôè</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Regarding <a href="https://til.micro.blog">Today I Learned</a>:</p>

<p>The project is currently on hiatus (covered in <a href="https://til.micro.blog/2021/07/08/today-i-learned.html">the latest update</a>). Whilst part of the reason for this is good (the aforementioned move), there is also a negative motivation; my work is currently unsustainable.</p>

<p>What I mean is that I lack the hardware and software to both maintain and grow Today I learned, and have no way to gain those resources. These include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>A computer. The iPad isn‚Äôt good enough as the only machine.</li>
<li>Hosted services. Email, hosted accounts, sharing, storage, publishing.</li>
<li>Editing software. Graphics, code, video.</li>
</ul>

<p>The greater access to these tools, the sooner I can push my ideas into full production across the project.</p>

<p>Whilst this issue might be resolved in the near future (as a result of the move), it is also possible that the change to my family‚Äôs life will be so significant that there will be no room at all. Even if I were to be in a much better position to work on Today I Learned, it offers no immediate and obvious route for either earning money directly or in the near future; any potential path for advancing my career ambitions seems to point to a long-term result. There is a great deal of uncertainty here.</p>

<p>I could gain the necessary resources but still choose to put an end to Today I Learned. In this instance I would instead do everything needed to attain paid work of a similar kind (independent, remote, maybe on the web) and use a combination of the existing published work of Today I Learned and the plans that are currently WIP as proof of my abilities in pursuit of said work. On top of that I would also continue to work on other, less ambitious ideas to beef up my body of work.</p>

<p>Given the limited space for me to do this kind of work, to do any sort of work, the time has come for me to make a decision. I am ready to take the next step with regard to ambitions beyond my work as a carer and home-maker. Now the question remains:</p>

<p>Continue with Today I Learned or commit to work in which resources are guaranteed?</p>

         	<p>A quick update to say that I‚Äôm putting Today I Learned on hiatus as of this post. The aforementioned <a href="http://simonwoods.online/2021/06/29/summer-hiatus.html">unfinished work</a> will either be published when I return with the project, or will end up in the ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù pile.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm both excited about what‚Äôs to come but also nervous for <a href="https://micro.blog/TIL">@TIL</a>. Unfortunately at some point voluntarily-run projects just get out-run by the real world. Oh well, I guess‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Hopefully I‚Äôll be back before I expect but if not, thanks again everybody. It‚Äôs been wonderful to see that there are parts of the internet where some people are willing to support some of those lofty ideals from The Before Times.</p>

<p>Perhaps we‚Äôll meet again. :)</p>

         	<p>I didn‚Äôt think I would be writing this kind of message again but life is funny that way.</p>

<p>tl;dr ‚Äî Good news! My wife and I are moving for good reasons. I‚Äôm taking a break from the web for a few months, and putting Today I Learned back on hiatus until October at the earliest. This includes deciding whether Today I Learned will return at all.</p>

<p>Last week Claire and I took a trip to another part of the country, the purpose of which was for her to attend a job interview. The wonderful news is that she was offered the job! We took the contract home with us a day after we had arrived and then over the weekend continued to talk about this possibility; the prospect of moving again, only this time it would be different.</p>

<p>This time it would be into a place, in all sense of the word, that has much greater potential for us to do the things we‚Äôve been wanting to do for a long time. An opportunity not to be taken lightly.</p>

<p>Yesterday I took a brisk walk to the nearby post box and sent the signed contract on its way. So now, as seems to be the trendy thing to do on Micro.blog, we are moving. We‚Äôve done this a few times before but never with such a <em>household‚Äôs</em> worth of possessions nor to such a great opportunity. It‚Äôs fair to say that the next couple of months are going to be full of all the nervous energy you can think of, with all kinds of priorities shifted around.</p>

<p>What that means is a couple of things:</p>

<ol>
<li>It‚Äôs highly likely that I won‚Äôt be around on the web in general.</li>
<li>Today I Learned is yet again undergoing a period of inactivity; a hiatus, for at least 3 months.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first point is not so bad, since it‚Äôs good to take a break from the internet on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The second, however, is complicated‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I have been so happy to gradually bring Today I Learned back to life, and up until the past couple of weeks things were going particularly well. Now I have been given an opportunity to think about the project in the long-run, to consider my opportunities and what may come.</p>

<p>Right now there is no more room for Today I Learned. I am limited by my resources, or lack thereof, <em>and</em> have reached a point where I am ready to work on more than just a hobby project whilst lacking the opportunity to make Today I Learned more than it is.</p>

<p>Over the next week or so I‚Äôll publish the few posts and edits that are already in the works. After that I‚Äôll post an update when the hiatus begins, and that‚Äôll be all for the next few months.</p>

<p>So I‚Äôll be back in October either way. See you then!</p>

<p>At least with my old Windows machine I could brute-force certain things ‚Äî you know, like you can when you have an actual functioning browser ‚Äî but on the iPad that‚Äôs either not possible or full of so many little catches that it becomes a fool‚Äôs errand.</p>

<p>For all of the things I like about this machine, and that list is long in comparison, the fact remains that my old and busted Windows computer was overall a much better computer.</p>

<p>To that end, I agree <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/04/26/inch-ipad-pro.html">with Manton‚Äôs incredulity regarding price disparity</a> and now wish that I had chosen a Mac of some kind instead of this iPad.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Over on the Micro.blog Help forums, <a href="https://micro.blog/numericcitizen">@numericcitizen</a> said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is MB a side-line for Manton ? Is there other people involved in maintaining this platform? I wasn‚Äôt expecting the pandemic to be an issue for an internet-only business like MB. I could be wrong, for sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From what I understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>Manton does large amounts of the work for the tech side of things (servers, new code, etc). That‚Äôs on top of support, marketing, long-term planning, being the most visible part of the platform, <em>and</em> you know, having a life.</li>
<li>The pandemic literally affected every part of our lives. A virus doesn‚Äôt care what type of business you have.</li>
<li>Texas, where Manton lives, was hit badly by a ridiculous weather event, only further compacting the pandemic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, where I definitely think you are wrong is the scope of Micro.blog and how it differs from other such platforms. Guess what? We <strong>don‚Äôt</strong> want the team to work themselves to the bone in a terrible environment and thus inevitably burn-out.</p>

<p>Have you listened to Manton on the Micro Monday podcast? Between every episode on which he has featured, including the latest, and the way he writes about Micro.blog it shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult to understand how this works. In fact in that most recent episode (the 100th, with Patrick Rhone) there was a discussion about Micro.blog taking on new people. Not only that but Manton‚Äôs own development podcast, Timetable, also covers some of these issues.</p>

<p>Maybe some of these things aren‚Äôt obvious enough and it would be good to make it explicit in some way. However, I could be completely wrong about all of it. ü§∑</p>

<p>(Aside: @-mentioning Manton in your reply was an odd choice, as if you‚Äôre trying to call him out. I hope that wasn‚Äôt your intent.)</p>

<p>Of course this is not disimilar to worrying about S3, Azure, and even Google&rsquo;s own server hosting. Then take a look at technologies such as React, massive software development-based sites like GitHub, and even the ties between the open web and mega-companies like Samsung with regard to open source&hellip;</p>

<p>The internet, much like the real world, shows many paths to living life connected to all sorts of awful people with very few options for small, self-starting groups of people to truly establish themselves free from the hideous behemoths our societies have built over the past many decades.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not discouraged by this. I simply believe you have to gain an understanding of the mountainous obstacles that stand before you, should you wish to overcome them at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You‚Äôll have to excuse my ignorance here, but you could elaborate on the negative effects of hashtags? I‚Äôm new to the IndieWeb philosophy, and having just come from the likes of Twitter and Instagram, the lack of hashtags here has made it difficult for discovery. I‚Äôm wondering what the workaround is, and why hashtags would be a negative thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href="https://micro.blog/vivianlee/10071751">original comment</a>)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not as well-informed on all of the technical aspects or any work that has been done to support this position &ndash; case studies, etc &ndash; but I do have a general view based on my experiences in the hashtag-heavy platforms vs. Micro.blog and my old days on message boards and the like.</p>

<p>A lot of the behaviour around hashtags for those with ill will is about tracking and campaigning at speed; using algorithms for trending to target and pile-on people and groups. It can also become easy to ruin a topic that has until that point been carefully curated by the people involved, whether through crude spambots or planned, targeted campaigns.</p>

<p>The flip-side of that is of course moderation, whether from the people running the platform or via account-based tools made available to each person. Whilst I&rsquo;m not aware of what <em>exactly</em> could be done with such resources, I know for sure that either way it is likely to be a lot of work for such a small team.</p>

<p>There is also the question of priorities within the context of culture; are hashtags, with all of the associated work, what Micro.blog needs right now? From my experience this is the kind of mechanism that can <em>quickly</em> lead to significant unintended consequences and so the positive value &ndash; which is basically just discovery &ndash; needs to be carefully weighed against the costs.</p>

<p>As for the alternatives, on Micro.blog it&rsquo;s a mix of direct-ish approaches;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.micro.blog/2018/tagmoji/">tagmoji</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://help.micro.blog/2019/following/">discover search</a>;</li>
<li>and <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2020/categories/">categories for hosted blogs</a>;</li>
</ul>

<p>and the in-direct approach that has become part of the culture of Micro.blog;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.micro.blog/2019/discover-timeline/">the Discover timeline</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://help.micro.blog/2019/micro-monday/">Micro Monday</a>;</li>
<li>and <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/07/12/following-users-ui.html">the <em>not-following</em> list on profiles</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note: there is also a <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2019/finding-people/">Micro.blog help page covering this subject</a>)</p>

<p>These alternatives also work well with philosophies of the open web, which preclude the silos; specifcally, the idea of the <a href="https://inessential.com/2018/02/01/why_micro_blog_is_not_another_app_net">open web as the great social network</a>, where we use feeds, email, newsletters, and other such technology and platforms that are largely non-proprietary. This means greater agency, independence, control, and less manipulation for all involved; it becomes a lot less like everybody dumping their posts into a bucket of faceless, nameless <em>content</em> whilst parasitical entities take advantage of our ignorance and lack of ownership.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think hashtags are intrinisic to the destructive nature of the web, rather I am unaware of any way for a small team to harness their power without sacrificing the good of Micro.blog; the intention, the curation, the personal contact, the idea that we are all people sharing space with some degree of control, and choosing to take our actions no matter what they might be.</p>

<p>This is the first time in over a decade that I have not used a PC on a daily basis, and whilst I yearn for a tool with which to work on <a href="https://micro.blog/til">@til</a> the fact remains that this process has cleared my mind of an unhealthy reliance on the web as my only source for information and, well, just about everything else.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to the continued rediscovering of the good habits from my pre-online life <em>and</em> developing a much better balance of my time and energy in the future, should I ever own a PC again.</p>

         	<p>Today I Learned is <a href="https://til.micro.blog/2020/05/28/maintenance-mode.html">now in maintenance mode</a>.</p>

<p>I am currently sitting at our desk in what we once called the office. Now it‚Äôs the utility room. This change, like so many others over the past two and a half months, has been monumental and yet so small.</p>

<p>Lots of things are happening, some of which I may or may not talk about but altogether can be summarised thus: I‚Äôm finally taking my work seriously, giving it the space and resources needed to get the job done at a basic standard let alone anything approaching <em>good</em>. All in all, this is a good thing, and made all the easier due to lots and lots of changes since even before the COVID-19 pandemic became the wrecking ball of change with which we are all currently attempting to grapple.</p>

<p>As for Today I Learned, well, the unfortunate truth is that I do not have the resources to spare for its continued operation and so the recent hiatus has now become a full maintenance mode which, as the previously linked announcement states, means there will be no publishing of any kind for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>I find it difficult to express my gratitude for all of the support from the Micro.blog community for Today I Learned. So I‚Äôll just say this: if you‚Äôre feeling pessimistic about the web and the world in general, please take part in the Micro.blog community for at least a few months and you‚Äôll find yourself living in an example of how the world can be a better place. Without this community I wouldn‚Äôt be in such a positive place as to handle monumental change and actually thrive, it‚Äôs as simple as that.</p>

<p>Over the next few months I‚Äôll probably continue to be elusive as far as posting is concerned. At the moment I‚Äôm mostly reading feeds, reading in general, watching the various forms of video available via the web, and playing lots of video games. In many ways I‚Äôm in a maintenance mode of my own; I have increased the volume of input from the world, this amazing world we‚Äôve made via the web, whilst simultaneously decreasing my output. This process has been&hellip; necessary. Vital even.</p>

<p>So I‚Äôm off to continue focusing on the most important parts of my life, and enjoying a summer of much needed self reflection.</p>

<p>I hope everybody who reads this is well and doing what is needed to live in this our strange pandemic-influenced time.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll see you in the replies. üëã</p>

         	<p>Recently watched my first Studio Ghibli film,  <em>Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind</em>. My planned viewing of every film from the studio fits nicely <a href="https://micro.welltempered.net/2020/04/29/coming-may-micro.html">with the Micro Challenge Sprints</a>. üìΩ</p>

<p>This is a great way to start writing more often about the things I enjoy. Thanks, <a href="https://micro.blog/macgenie">@macgenie</a>! üòä</p>

         	<p><a href="https://blog.simonwoods.online/2020/02/26/with-firefox-alone.html">The literal cost of using the modern web slapped me in the face just now</a>. It got me thinking&hellip;</p>

<p>This is one of those things that inspires me to think about what life would be like if I gave up being as involved with the web as I currently am.</p>

<p>I could save the desktop for mostly offline work, with limited access to the web saved purely for uploading/sharing stuff, and then rely mostly on mobile computing. This could fit in with spending more time outside, taking my new main computer with me, and generally avoid the muck of tracking-based platforms of services.</p>

<p>IDK&hellip; maybe becoming &ldquo;anti-connected&rdquo; to some degree. Essentially reverse my general trend of the past decade and switch much more of my focus to the people near me. I wouldn&rsquo;t be anywhere near as involved with the web because I simply wouldn&rsquo;t have the time or other resources, as part of an intentional decision to free myself of the misery that is the modern web.</p>

<p>However! I could still work on TIL. I mean, the beauty of Micro.blog is that I don&rsquo;t have to sell my soul to really understand it, test things out, etc.</p>

<p>A lot of these thoughts have become possible thanks to moving to Firefox. Between the Containers feature and lack of focus on the Google silo, it really has helped me to think about what I am doing on the web through a lens of pragmatism and with a greater degree of transparency.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time for me to think about this in a real way, to make changes that are practical. I actually think it will help a lot with TIL, since it lines up nicely with the philosophies upon which Micro.blog was built. In particular it&rsquo;s the idea of a &ldquo;good web&rdquo;, in which we have the ability to control our online presence and not have to accept a life lived as little more than value-based data, a faceless thing there to be used for the efforts of other people to increase their ill-gotten gains.</p>

<p>This is a lot of meta-style talk, which I didn&rsquo;t want to spend so much time on in public posts. However, it is a significant process for me on a number of levels and I would like to have a public record of my thinking as I go through the process of making the aforementioned changes over the next few months.</p>

         	<p>A skill for the web that is worth taking your time to learn and improve upon: asking questions.</p>

<p>Many people seem to easily stray into the area of <em>demanding</em> something, and I would guess it&rsquo;s mostly because they don&rsquo;t stop to read aloud their question before hitting &lsquo;send&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&ndash; <a href="https://microblog.onemanandhisblog.com/2020/02/21/this-post-by.html">Adam Tinworth</a></p>

<p>Having shared <a href="https://euansemple.blog/2020/02/21/shit-tinted-glasses/">Euan Semple&rsquo;s thought-provoking post</a>, Adam got a fairly quick reply <a href="https://micro.blog/petebrown/8443490">from Pete Brown</a> which only further provoked me to once again consider a general viewpoint I have been wrestling with for the past few years.</p>

<p>An important point of context within these issues that is often neglected: these companies, this version of the web, a lot of it is US-centric. They are literally constructs made from the culture of the US, and whilst of course they are also built with a diversity of viewpoints I think it is vital to remember that there <em>is</em> a difference in how these things are built even compared to that which is most similar, for example Canada.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe I live in too much of a bubble of my circumstances in life but the fact remains that I have yet to meet people who are so desparately in need of the connected web on our own little island, as compared to seemingly large numbers of Americans for whom the internet has been something of a lifeboat. Not to say it <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> significant here, of course it is, but rather that there is difference in the difference even between our two relatively similar nations&hellip; that the environment is different, there are different motivations for the various part of our societies, and that&rsquo;s before we even get to Europe and further afield.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just never quite felt that if I were to sacrifice the internet my life would be inescapably ruined; at least with regard to the social, overly worked part of the internet where the silos and the like exist. As such I have never quite felt that this is necessarily a socio-economic aspect of our lives that requires constant and immediate care. In many ways, it truly is what it is and little else.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The firmer I become in my convictions that the independent web is the neccessary alternative to social media, the more likely I am to question that feeling.</p>

<p>Have the silos simply figured it out and we, as a species, inevitably trend to this system?</p>

<p>If so, then the independent alternative is surely a waste of time.</p>

<p>Life should be about <em>people</em> and if all of the people on the web are in the silos, then that is where we should be.</p>

<p>Sure, a bunch of people might reply to this &ndash; I have been very lucky to find a great community on Micro.blog, for example &ndash; and that might include lengthy replies with fiery disagreements to my conclusions.</p>

<p>But ask yourself: who will read that?</p>

<ul>
<li>The people who are so busy living their lives that they don&rsquo;t have time to read blogs? I doubt it.</li>
<li>The people who read blogs and oppose social media (except that they have social media accounts for totally legitimate serious reasons you couldn&rsquo;t possibly pick apart we promise)? Congratulations, you are preaching to the choir.</li>
<li>The people who have similar values and will make breakthroughs in convincing the mainstream to reject social media? That&rsquo;s possible! After all, people like Manton Reece and Jean MacDonald enjoy reading blogs.</li>
<li>The people who wield influence in our broader socio-economic systems, which have provided the support structures for silos to both exist and monopolise the web? Even if they read it, the chances they would change anything to balance out the silos are likely small.</li>
</ul>

<p>So why are we bothering?</p>

<p>Why do we build against the silos?</p>

<p>What makes the independent web &ndash; in its current environment that is hostile to the average user of silos &ndash; worth adopting, warts and all?</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>(I&rsquo;m getting this bullshit out of my system.)</p>

<p>Potential Twitter set-up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tiny follow list, mostly read in a RSS reader via <a href="https://feedbin.com/blog/2018/01/11/feedbin-is-the-best-way-to-read-twitter/">Feedbin&rsquo;s brilliant integration</a>.</li>
<li>Everything else followed via lists, with the Pinned Lists feature in the first-party app.</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as settings go, that depends on how the above works out. If I end up following a larger group of people than intended (for example, if the pinned lists and RSS integration don&rsquo;t work well, as I&rsquo;m sure Twitter would prefer) there will be no retweets in my timeline, I&rsquo;ll constantly keep the chronological option switched on, and will maintain a significant list of filters.</p>

<p>I love third-party apps but am convinced they&rsquo;re not long for this world. Honestly, even with this specific set-up the whole point is to make it easier to stay away from the empty-headed, addictive use of a platform that is designed specifically to inspire that behaviour. As such, I&rsquo;ll have time limits in place, which is a big part of my life anyway what with having more than one job and actual responsibilities with actual consequences if they aren&rsquo;t fulfilled.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you&rsquo;re reading this and follow me over there please don&rsquo;t be offended if I don&rsquo;t [pound-sign]FollowBack. That&rsquo;s just now I use these things and that is unlikely to ever change.</p>

<p>OK. Let&rsquo;s see if that has flushed this nonsense from my mind, at least in its current state of heistant wreckage.</p>

         	<p>Lately I continue to think about <a href="https://blog.simonwoods.online/2019/11/18/social-network-conundrum.html">my social network conundrum</a>.</p>

<p>I have wittled down my indecision to just Twitter. It&rsquo;s easy enough for me to draw the line with regard to personal use of the other big social networks, at least for now.</p>

<p>All that&rsquo;s left at this point is to weigh the effort of maintaining a non-terrible experience against losing the good people who are exclusive to that platform. Even with RSS, awesome smaller networks like that of Micro.blog, and newsletters the fact remains that a number of people are fun to follow blogging-wise and they do so exclusively on Twitter.</p>

<p>This is an issue I would like to resolve, at least for the foreseeable future. To some extent it is a waste of my time, a distraction, and not the good kind. This is exactly what I am determined to avoid as much as possible.</p>

<p>Anyway. Blogging about blogging. I&rsquo;m super fucking original that way.</p>

         	<p>Blogging on Windows is frustrating. So many times I want to quickly share a quote, a basic link, whatever. I then see Apple people talking about pre-formatted sharing with blockquotes, et al, and it just makes me sad that optimised blogging doesn&rsquo;t exist on Windows and Chrome.</p>

         	<p>When it comes to mainstream silos vs the independent web and the growing options, this is my constant conflict:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God damn it this is all crap, not just ethically but the design is terrible; ads, unreliable performance, genuinely bad UI, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>VS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What does it matter; if the goal is to share to as many people as possible then just swallow the terrible option as a basic broadcasting tool whilst putting serious energy into the good options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>VS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Life is too short, just use the popular one, invest time and energy in physical spaces, and save the ethically minded digital activity for stuff like security and identity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>VS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Life is too short to NOT make the ethically good decision. Better to sacrifice some shallow things (in this case there are plentiful non-Instagram options for good and better photographers) and live a life knowing you made as many good decisions as possible.</p>

<p>Manton had <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/11/17/whenever-a-new.html">more to say about this today</a> and I agree with him. Whether those of us who are driven in any way by ideological motives like it or not, the fact remains that copy-pasting functionality from the existing behemoths is a complete waste of time.</p>

<p>Why would anyone bother with your new thing if it just does what the existing thing does, only with fewer people? That is not an effective way to motivate people and we&rsquo;re never going to change anything if we fail to understand how people are motivated to make changes in their lives.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://simonwoods.online/2019/08/28/replies-on-microblog.html">Replies on Micro.blog</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://simonwoods.online/2019/08/28/replies-on-microblog.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-08-28 21:14:00 &#43;0000">Aug 28, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="https://micro.blog/walter/5242648">A reply to the ongoing discussion about replies</a></p>

<p>Going back to at least earlier this year it seemed like the limit on replies was going to be shortened, or at least that was the plan, and if that does happen at any point then all of a sudden the whole &ldquo;let&rsquo;s start a conversation&rdquo; dynamic is much different; perhaps people would be more inclined to take such conversations elsewhere (messaging services, email, physical space, etc) and so the value of the short-reply conversation (micro-convo if you will) stands alone.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a chance with only short replies allowed that replies themselves will take on more of their own identity, and a core part of that will be the shorter replies themselves. Then they would be not just something that is so easily considered clutter. However, I do agree with Smokey that these issues could be better solved via timeline filtering, of which there is already a foundation (filtering out mentions to people you do not follow) <em>and</em> as compared to introducing a &ldquo;like&rdquo; system is much less likely to fundamentally alter the entire platform.</p>

<p>I also like <a href="https://micro.blog/johnjohnston/5256922">John&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;disappearing likes.&rdquo;</a> It reminds me of how Snapchat first became popular due to disappearing posts, except this could serve as less destructive version of &ldquo;likes&rdquo; in general.</p>

<p>Overall when it comes to cluttered timelines I&rsquo;m not at all convinced that introducing a reply-wide change to the system is the best way to go, since it feels too much like shoving something on everybody because <em>some</em> people think of short replies as clutter. For those who do think this way, have you considered using RSS in conjunction with Micro.blog? I find it&rsquo;s easier to get at the exact posts you want this way, rather than looking to turn the conversation host (Micro.blog) into something fundamentally different.</p>

<p>Right now replies definitely need some updates and I think this is one of the issues that ought to be addressed. Personally, as somebody outside of the Apple ecosystem I feel there are bigger problems; even short replies are hard work when it comes to just using the web but I think updates to the replies feature across all systems would be a great upgrade for Micro.blog as a whole.</p>

<p>It is utterly frustrating to see &ldquo;everybody&rdquo; (read: lots of mostly active people) using these silos, these services, and just going along with it like cattle. It is a wave of lazy living, lazy thinking, and fear-lead decision making that has brought us to a point wherein <em>good</em> stories on the web are now largely trapped within ecosystems that are increasingly designed to be prisons and little more.</p>

<p>The question is: just give up and go with the crowd, or continue to hold what you think is the better idea &ndash; in this instance: the open web, open standards, websites made to good standards, accessible postings, and the slow and steady growth of the technologies therein &ndash; in the hope that eventually our stories and ideas will become less trapped?</p>

         	<p>There are a number of different third-party Micro.blog projects in development. Using <em>Today I Learned</em> (<a href="https://micro.blog/til">@til</a>), you can find and keep up to date on their progress.</p>

         	<p>The new community-based projects have made me think about one of my favourite things about Micro.blog; this is not an effort to &ldquo;replace Twitter&rdquo; or anything like that. Rather the community is proving that it is an effort to try something <em>different</em> with the social web.</p>

         	<p>(Note: I originally wrote this on Slack, <a href="https://microblogging.slack.com/archives/C3TMLHTL2/p1560377760084100">as part of a thread about Micro.blog as a name</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know naming isn&rsquo;t easy but I think I find it hard because M.b gets used for the company, individual blogs, the app and the timeline respectively in the following sentence (although arguably the second &ldquo;Micro.blog&rdquo; should be &ldquo;microblog&rdquo;):</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I post to my Micro.blog hosted Micro.blog using Micro.blog it gets cross-posted to Micro.blog&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ndash; Matthew Lindfield Seager (<a href="https://micro.blog/matt17r">@matt17r</a>), <a href="https://microblogging.slack.com/archives/C3TMLHTL2/p1560373981077700">in the Indie Microblogging Slack</a></p>

<p>I think part of the issue here, especially if you&rsquo;re going to compare to social media silos, is that they are not interested in differentiating these things&hellip; whether it&rsquo;s Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, YouTube, whatever&hellip; they are simply interested in people not ever thinking about the technical side of things.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Micro.blog fully embraces the technical side of things yet is also driven by a desire to make things as simple as possible.</p>

<p>As such, tbh, things aren&rsquo;t cleanly and easily tucked into a nice little marketable pocket of jargon. If people don&rsquo;t like the inevitable downsides of social media silos then they&rsquo;re going to have to at least become aware of things like &ldquo;blogs&rdquo;, &ldquo;posts&rdquo;, &ldquo;microblogs&rdquo;, and so on.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean people have to become experts or even especially comfortable with these concepts but they will need to acknowledge that there is no easy, one-size-fits-all answer for posting and sharing things on the web. Maybe over time the language will get easier but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be because the marketing improves; rather, it&rsquo;s time for people on the web to become better citizens.</p>

<p>No one is forcing these game developers to take these jobs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ndash; <a href="https://micro.blog/frostedechoes">@frostedechoes</a>, <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2019/05/27/jason-morehead-writes.html">on the effects felt by developers when creating violent video games</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst I understand this isn&rsquo;t the core of Robert&rsquo;s point, I will note that I see this kind of qualifier quite a lot across different issues, and I think it&rsquo;s important for all of us to also make note of the fact that there is an agent influencing the decisions of, well, everybody. That agent is the socio-economic system, the culture we prop up with our many decisions, for which there is no current alternative. If we had a better alternative then things could be different; for example, introducing both universal healthcare and universal basic income would create <em>significant</em> foundations upon which we could all make better decisions.</p>

<p>To put it bluntly, in many cases these developers are in the USA and these terrible jobs are still preferable to having no job, almost entirely due to the punitive treatment of unemployment in said country.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://opuszine.us/posts/how-violent-video-games-affect-their-developers">looking at what Jason has said</a>, he ends with the idea of questioning whether to support certain art or not. Again, an easy thing, Jason is taking the much easier route of looking at this small insignificant piece&hellip; those pieces do <strong>nothing</strong> when compared to the foundational issues here, even if they are much easier to talk about.</p>

<p>I think people neglect to write blog posts because the feedback loop is not as tangible as the onslaught of (sometimes mechanical) likes or faves that you can receive on a social network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ndash; <a href="https://bitsplitting.org/2019/05/24/blog-a-little/">Daniel Jalkut, <em>Blog a Little</em></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame people believe what those at Facebook, Twitter, and such like would prefer them to believe; specifically, just because the audience seems to be all on those closed networks that it is therefore the best option to just post everything there and never have an independent, self-owned option as the core of whatever you are posting.</p>

<p>Instead, it&rsquo;ll be great even if people just change how they think about the whole system, to realise that the closed networks can be useful for specific types of broadcasting but that&rsquo;s about it. Even then, with regard to messaging not only do we have feed technology but also email and the unbelievable flexibility of open web software as a whole.</p>

<p>It has been encouraging to see the influential voices of the web become louder about these issues in the past few years. It might not be obvious at first but the truth is that we can only build a better world if we learn from our history, identify the good in what we have done, and then attempt to build on that. I truly believe that we can maintain the internet as a force for good, specifically with the web, so long as we hold close to the values of independence, generous spirit, and free thinking; all of which are possible with a web that itself is as open and independent as possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LongLiveTheOpenWeb?src=hash">#LongLiveTheOpenWeb</a> is another good piece in a movement well worth your time, doubtless there will be more to come and we will all be here, ready to blog a lot.</p>

         	<p>There&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/numericcitizen/3438266">an interesting conversation here regarding Apple and support documentation</a>, specifically with regard to what is missing.</p>

<p>This is embarrassing. &ldquo;It Just Works&rdquo; should more than cover <em>documentation</em>. I don&rsquo;t know how many people I&rsquo;ve read and heard in revered tone about &ldquo;The Most Holy HIG&rdquo; and so on&hellip; seriously, they are a <strong>trillion dollar company</strong> and don&rsquo;t have the resources to make comprehensive guidance across ALL formats? That is utter bullshit and completely user hostile.</p>

<p>Oh, also, don&rsquo;t forget that &ldquo;you&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo; will make an appearance from time-to-time whenever the executives have been lowered to our level in response to something on which the company has fucked up.</p>

<p>I see a lot of &ldquo;they&rsquo;re premium&rdquo; whenever somebody brings up Apple being expensive. Irrespective of the realities of premium or not, Apple certainly <em>screams</em> premium with everything they do but the deep holes in their user documentation, whatever the format, is terrible and counter to even the slightest notion of a premium experience.</p>

<p>I was <a href="https://blog.simonwoods.online/2019/03/22/goodbye-internet.html">getting ahead of myself</a>. <em>Today I Learned</em> is not going to stop &ndash; to be fair, <a href="https://micro.blog/handy/2870044">that seemed unlikely anyway</a> &ndash; but I did need to take a break, to take a few steps back and think about why it was that I felt the way I did; I was tired and in pain, generally feeling down, and none of it had anything to do with a need for TIL to stop.</p>

<p>Rather, I need to do two things;</p>

<ul>
<li>be patient with myself;</li>
<li>be kinder to myself.</li>
</ul>

<p>I may or may not elaborate further on this in some form or another but I think that&rsquo;s enough for now. The core of this post is to say that TIL is very much back on track, <a href="https://til.micro.blog/2019/04/23/updates-lots-happening.html">with updates and all</a>, and I am committed to it &ndash; barring any major life-altering events &ndash; for at least another 12 months.</p>

<p>The ten days that were my unplanned break were illuminating to say the least. It feels good to be back.</p>

         	<p>I am no longer maintaining <a href="https://til.micro.blog">Today I Learned</a>.</p>

<p>Having given the project a lot of thought, specifically within the context of my life the fact is that I do not have the resources with which to make this work. This is actually a realisation on a larger scale for me personally; insofar as I do not have room for <em>any</em> such project in my life.</p>

<p>I am a carer, that is my job, and attempting to have a second job as a remote worker is an effort that is simply beyond me; I have no way of doing that with minimal effort, rather I work as hard and with as much efficiency as possible and all of this simply doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>A combination of factors leave me very much in the wrong place to attempt to continue with this effort and it is important for me to recognise this and move on. I still think Micro.blog and similar efforts are a much healthier, more sustainable alternative to the corporate silos that have come to dominate the web and hope to see more and more people come to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>The sites and account will remain but there will be no new activity at all. If anybody wants to take what&rsquo;s there, well, it&rsquo;s all easily copied anyway so there&rsquo;s nothing new about that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank everybody for your support with the project, from Jean and Manton through to those who replied to posts and so on; as usual, the community on Micro.blog has proven to be pretty damn good even in these early days. You&rsquo;re all brilliant.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now I will be taking a break from blogging and generally posting on the web, and taking my time to think about what I am doing next, if anything on top of my job. I have serious doubts if anything other than volunteering will fit into my life but who knows&hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s everything for now.</p>

<p>Goodbye, Internet.</p>

<p>&ndash; <a href="https://social.cheribaker.com/2019/03/13/my-new-internet.html">Cheri Baker, My New Internet Habits</a></p>

<p>Cheri has found the exact kind of mental discipline I had spoken about at the end of last year.</p>

<p>My goals, similar to her own with regard to time spent online are nowhere near closer than when I first set them out on this blog. It should be no surprised to me, then that the first two months of this year have been marked by a general downturn in my mood, my overall health really.</p>

<p>This stops now.</p>

<p>Not only have I already deactivated my personal social media accounts barring Micro.blog, I have reset my RSS feeds and am in the midst of taking a knife to the throat of any excess with regard to email, task managers (read: <a href="https://gabz.me/2019/03/09/can-a-productivity.html">Gabriel Santiago&rsquo;s take</a> on Jillianne Hamilton&rsquo;s <a href="https://jilly.ca/2019/03/can-a-productivity-nerd-live-without-a-to-do-list/"><em>Can a Productivity Nerd Live Without a To-Do List?</em></a>), and so on.</p>

<p>I am stripping away the noise, making firm decisions about my work set-up (minimised to better focus on the most immediate tasks), and filtering the crap away to stop it from getting into my mind.</p>

<p>Soon I hope to also report that I am reading more books, reading higher quality news, increasing my exercise, <em>and</em> getting much more writing done.</p>

         	<p>A question I have has been previously asked by somebody else on the Microsoft support forum thing, specifically: how can I create calendars using the Windows Calendar app.</p>

<p>From a &ldquo;Microsoft Agent | Moderator&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As of the moment, we&rsquo;ll have to wait until there is an option for adding a new, personalized calendar to the Calendar app. This will be a great addition to the Calendar app, so we encourage you to submit your idea using the Feedback Hub app so that our developers can see it and consider adding this feature in future updates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&hellip; in August, 2017.</p>

<p>I&hellip; this is seriously from the company once broken up because of its monopoly in <em>computers</em>.</p>

<p>It is breathtakingly stupid to see the fucking Calendar app not have a <em>create calendar</em> feature. I spend plenty of time with my iPad or Pixel and don&rsquo;t have even one tenth the level of stress-induced headaches as I do with Microsoft&rsquo;s software.</p>

<p>Now on my to-do list:</p>

<ol>
<li>Move relevant tech back to Google stuff; I have a fucking Pixel so why I am bothering with other big vendors is now beyond me.</li>
<li>Get Dropbox set up again; they and Backblaze are the only palatable major third-party developers with whom I have been satisfied with regard to these large file-based tasks.</li>
<li>Rip every single Microsoft thing I can from my digital life and continue to barely tolerate their shitty operating system, for now.</li>

         	<p>I keep going back and forth on this but as somebody who needs a computer ‚Äì even in the case of a laptop ‚Äì that can be durable and capable, I‚Äôm less convinced that I should be looking at a Mac as each day passes. A Microsoft notebook might be the way to go.</p>

<p><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/10/27/new-macbook-pros-and-the-state-of-the-mac/">This page from Michael Tsai is Exhibit A for my continued unease</a>. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m likely to get a MacBook Pro, especially not as my first Mac but the progression, or lack thereof, in the higher end models is a sign of how well the lower end models will be treated. To be frank, the price of the new MacBook Air is not enough to put me off but the terribly negligence displayed by Apple toward the Mac in general is disconcerting.</p>

<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m waiting to see if they&rsquo;ll continue supplying regular updates (which to be fair, they have since the 2016 redesign) <em>and</em> revert some of the bad decisions of the past two years, and if they don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll avoid the Mac entirely and compare instead the iPad Pro to Windows laptops.</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2018/10/16/the-2018-macbook-keyboards-have-the-same-old-problems/">Another set of updates from Michael Tsai</a></p>

<p>Seriously, even if I wasn&rsquo;t poor there is no way I will be able to tolerate this seemingly terrible keyboard. I write <em>way too much</em> to ever work efficiently; I barely have time enough for this work as it is!</p>

        <a href="https://simonwoods.online/2019/01/20/cutting-the-cord.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-01-20 19:48:44 &#43;0000">Jan 20, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I no longer want to be tied up in various accounts for platforms and services, to be tied to black-box style technology with which if you have any issues it <em>just</em> <strong><em>doesn&rsquo;t</em></strong> <em>work</em> and you&rsquo;re left to shrug and wait for things to get better. Of course I know that it would be ridiculous to have full and total control over every piece of technology, since that would involve constant maintenance and other investments for which the vast majority of people have no room in their already full lives. However, not every possible app and service is necessary &ndash; no, this is not an advert for Marie Kondo &ndash; and whenever I think about just how much control of my life I am handing over to corporations there is an inexorable sinking feeling, bordering on despair.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s kinda shit. So I&rsquo;m not doing it anymore. Let&rsquo;s look at what I&rsquo;ve got:</p>

<ul>
<li>iCloud</li>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Amazon</li>
<li>Microsoft</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the largest arbiters of my digital life, and I would imagine relatively common for the people who are most likely to read this, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they are the only ones in my sights; I&rsquo;ll come back to the smaller platforms at a later date.</p>

<p><strong>iCloud</strong> is not going anywhere; not only is Apple the only company talking about, and acting on privacy with any sort of semblance of truth but I am also working towards a goal of trying all-in with them, for which iCloud is essential.</p>

<p><strong>Google</strong> is tough. To begin with it&rsquo;s not going anywhere since I have a Pixel 2 and after trying a different Launcher (Microsoft&rsquo;s no less) found performance and stability suffered massively when compared to the default set up; apparently Google are quickly taking Apple&rsquo;s approach with regard to &ldquo;controlling the experience&rdquo;. It is highly unlikely that I&rsquo;ll be able to change my phone for another year, so that&rsquo;s Android set in place.</p>

<p>On top of this is YouTube, which is not as bad as it once was since I have massively cut the amount of regular series I watch but is still a gradual process; fortunately some of my favourite channels offer alternative methods for watching their videos, so I will work on moving over to those.</p>

<p>Beyond that I have moved my search over to a combination of DuckDuckGo and web-based resources such as directories and blogs, whilst I am happy with Fastmail for email. The only other catch is Maps, for which Apple and Bing are the best alternatives but they&rsquo;re nowhere near as easy to access as Google on my phone and <em>that</em> is where I am likely to need a map the majority of the time.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon</strong> is likely to stay. Between an ever reliable back-up for delivered shopping and Prime it is currently in a strong position. Although, the move to Apple might negate Prime whilst attaining one of our current big domestic goals, getting a car, would put a dent in Amazon&rsquo;s power as a retailer. I would love to extract myself from their ecosystem entirely.</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> is the current backend for my task management, such as it is, but that can change easily enough over time. Other than that is Windows 10 which is in a strange position; either it&rsquo;s entirely fragile because of how much better Mac OS is <em>or</em> I&rsquo;m not all that convinced by Mac OS and Windows becomes the unquestionable default for my desktop and laptop needs. Even if the operating system stays, there will still be options for third party software, such as they are on Windows.</p>

<p><strong>Twitter</strong> has gone from the unquestionable social network for me to an entirely disposable, infected waste of space. My remaining account is used to convince people to join Micro.blog, a cost I am currently willing to pay since it is so entirely locked down and focused away from the maddening flood that is the inner-most thoughts of millions of people. Also: fuck Jack Dorsey.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook</strong> stopped being my hub for anything years ago; I went from deleting my years-old account, to reactivating and maintaining it in &ldquo;private mode&rdquo; (LOL), to inevitably trashing it altogether. Since then Instagram, and to a lesser degree WhatsApp remained a hook into the ecosystem but they are both gone now. Much like the rest of these huge platforms, there are better alternatives for which my mental health is eternally thankful. Also: fuck Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

<p>I am now actively seeking out either non-account or non-services software for the bare essentials I need. We are in the era of <em>Noise</em> when it comes to software evolution for the masses and I no longer want to be weighed down by the mammoth task of moving the whole world to be plugged into one space.</p>

<p>Whilst I still believe it is true that these monopoly-abusing companies host the platforms upon which &ldquo;everybody lives&rdquo; to some extent, I simply no longer wish to bear the cost of it; I refuse to live my life by the compromised standards of other people.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be posting a follow-up to this, looking more into the future in a similar manner as I have written before now. I agree with <a href="https://www.baty.net/2019/now-that-ive-deleted-social-network/">Jack Baty with regard to where we ought to be putting our energy</a>; great, I got rid of the thing that is bad, so what is next? Let&rsquo;s all try to talk about that.</p>

         	<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; I have always thought of Facebook as a <em>necessary evil</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ndash; <a href="https://gabytron.me/2018/12/20/i-dont-know.html">Luis Gabriel Santiago Alvarado, <em>I don&rsquo;t know anymore!</em></a></p>

<p>A familiar feeling with which I empathise. The behemoths of the social web (silo platforms) have been constructed to have this exact effect on as many people as possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://micro.blog/garciabuxton/1506216">Joyce Garcia agrees</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s very heartening to know that I&rsquo;m not the only one struggling through decisions on the social media morass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Weighing up the value of where the crowd is, or at least appears to be, against the reality of contributing to a bad thing &ndash; often definitely <em>very bad things</em> &ndash; is difficult.</p>

<p>People might say &ldquo;oh but what do you think you&rsquo;re really contributing by leaving&rdquo; but the fact remains that as more people leave, even more people feel comfortable doing so; after a few consecutive years of steady decline in activity and visible membership, these silos have no real backup plan on which to rely. They are not web-friendly at all and with that comes the lack of local copies, which means everything <em>just disappears</em>, and people will inevitably see the patently destructive core of these systems.</p>

<p>Even the people who remain in the silos will likely change their approach to them; for example, Twitter as a simple means of producing a microblog feed <em>as well as</em> RSS. Over time enough people are only likely to get smarter about these platforms, in the aggregate, that their move away from the centre of our culture, our very societies is inevitable.</p>

<p>These platforms do not need to disappear; we simply need to put them in their place.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://simonwoods.online/2019/01/03/my-microblog-nonwishlist.html">My Micro.blog Non-Wishlist List</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://simonwoods.online/2019/01/03/my-microblog-nonwishlist.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-01-03 20:11:33 &#43;0000">Jan 3, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Last month I posted <a href="https://blog.simonwoods.online/2018/12/07/my-microblog-wishlist.html">my wishlist for Micro.blog</a>, outlining a number of items should they be implemented I feel would make significant contributions to the effort of making substantial improvements across the platform.</p>

<p>I built this list over time and that included removing items either implemented in that time or those that, upon reflection became less fitting for my list. Below is a list of some of these items, along with some quick thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Android</p>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps the most forcefully requested feature for Micro.blog at all, at least publicly. More than a few people have disregarded the platform altogether when it becomes obvious just how Apple-centric it is as far as apps are concerned.</li>
<li>Whilst I do think the platform will grow for the better with official Android support, I continue to believe it is unlikely to such an extent to be irrelevant, at least for now; if a significant portion of my list is implemented the lack of Android will soon become something of a highly visible flaw, <em>especially</em> for a platform founded on the principles of the open, inclusive web.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Windows</p>

<ul>
<li>Similar to the above issue with Android, although to a much lesser extent; aside from anything else, the web app is likely to be easier to access in a desktop-class browser. However, an app through which you are given a smooth and clean interface, even with just basic functionality, would be rather impressive on Windows; I say this as a lifetime user of Windows who has rarely seen third-party software worth talking about.</li>
<li>I wonder if a browser extension &ndash; at least for Firefox and Chrome, as well as Safari &ndash; would help a decent number of people for whom a Windows app would be appealing, at least in the short term.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Replies on hosted blog posts.</p>

<ul>
<li>This has been requested on more than a few occasions, especially from those for who the stated goals of Micro.blog are particularly attractive &ndash; for people to blog more/get back to blogging, something of a return to the old pre-social behemoth web, etc. Whilst I agree this would be a great feature, I do not believe it is important at a fundamental level for enough people to justify its theoretical status as a priority.
<br /></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Metrics.</p>

<ul>
<li>This includes direct access to your Following list in a way with which most people are familiar thanks to the increasingly homogenic design of mainstream social media, the very presence of public <em>Likes</em> and/or <em>Reactions</em>, and through to the likes of built-in stats for posts. Not only do I think this would muddle the main message through which Micro.blog is promoted, I have yet to be convinced that the presence of such features ever contribute to the net positive of platforms through which people seek to <em>discuss</em> ideas and matters at hand.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Search.</p>

<ul>
<li>Global search built right into Micro.blog. This will <em>immediately solve &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo;</em> or so it would seem when people react with shock at the lack of conventional search. Not only does the hosted search feature provide a practical option for those who are aligned with the philosophy behind Micro.blog (i.e. bloggers, including those who are more concerned with writing and posting than they are fiddling with technical toys) but the search available via Discover provides search within a focused context. For the moment that is more than enough.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>&lsquo;Show More&rsquo; everywhere (replies especially).</p>

<ul>
<li>I totally forgot about this. It is an example of feature parity, or lack thereof and whilst I would dearly love to see it (hi from Windows and Android üëãüèª) it&rsquo;s definitely not a deal-breaker nor a thing I believe would turn many people away, at least not in the short term.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I am confident there are plenty of other items I could have put here, however those are the ones I have noticed when it comes to looking at both the platform and community as a whole. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if any of these make progress ahead of my actual wishlist.</p>

         	<p>Sometimes things don&rsquo;t turn out the way you think they will. Life can be full of surprises that way. Here I am, not even a week into this year and already changes are afoot that even a few days ago I would not have expected. Let&rsquo;s get to those changes.</p>

<p>Updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Posted my CSS <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonmumbles/966e5d81ca07c7588ca2e26159361179">as a Gist</a>.

<ul>
<li>I use the Marfa theme for Mumblings, with a bunch of custom CSS to twist it into the shape I prefer. The code is now on GitHub, for anybody to grab and/or leave feedback. I&rsquo;ll also soon post it to this site.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Projects:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://theychoseus.wordpress.com/">They Chose Us</a> is a website dedicated to my cats, Kismet and Aria.</li>
<li><a href="https://firebyrduk.wordpress.com/">Firebyrd</a> is the home of my wife and I for our collaborative work, including our blog with which we will post updates.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Increased contributions to <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog">Micro.blog on GitHub</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://photos.simonwoods.online">Snapshot</a> has been put on indefinite hiatus.</li>
<li>Returned to <a href="https://twitter.com/simonmumbles">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/simonmumbles">Instagram</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The future:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://til.micro.blog">Today I Learned</a> returns proper on Monday, the 14th of January.

<ul>
<li>The December edition of <strong>The Macro Report</strong> will be back before then.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>For The Weekend</strong> returns this Friday, the 4th of January.</li>
<li>Introducing: <strong>Broken Ground</strong>, a photo-based record of the public infrastructure in Liverpool.

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to highlight the condition of the streets and roads in my local area, within the relevant context to talk about why this is important and exactly why, as citizens, we should demand more from both those in positions of authorities and each other.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Introducing: <strong>Chronicles of Thedas</strong>, a fan-site hosting stories set in the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe.</li>
<li>Regular longer form blogging is forthcoming on Mumblings, with a reduction of shorter posts.</li>
</ul>

<p>I briefly moved Mumblings, this site, from Micro.blog Hosted to Tumblr but now it is back again and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. I believe strongly in the work being done by the team, that Manton is right when he says the best future for the web is one made of smaller networks of higher quality rather than the current roster of social media behemoths.</p>

<p>I have big goals for this year and <em>Today I Learned</em> is a big part of that. I can&rsquo;t wait to restart the project on the 14th of the month, especially with the plans I have in place for further expansion.</p>

<p>I hope to get my Micro.blog Hosted photoblog back up before the end of the year, along with a couple of other blog-based ideas for which I am currently in the early planning stages. In the meantime I&rsquo;m going to keep blogging here and look forward to a year of even more people getting <em>back to blogging</em>.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>&ndash; Simon</p>

        <a href="https://simonwoods.online/2018/12/29/random-thoughts-blog.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-12-29 04:24:23 &#43;0000">Dec 29, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>During my downtime over Christmas I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the time I am spending on writing, especially with regard to how I am moving away from constant, daily blogging and toward longer form blogging whilst increasing my time on writing-based projects.</p>

<p>Between this and the pressing need to maintain my overall health &ndash; as a carer, there is no other choice; if I do not maintain my health then I <em>cannot do my job</em> &ndash; I am looking at cutting away those activities of my day-to-day life that are in fact excessive. A <a href="http://www.tones.nz/2018/12/29/one-thing-that.html">post from <em>tones</em></a> helped me see this ambition in the sharp reality that is text and I have never felt as driven to do my best work as I do right now.</p>

<p>That being said, there is no question that my decision to move away from regular shorter blogging is an important part of this focus; don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the activity is <em>brilliant</em> and has been integral to my year-long rejuvenation thanks to which I am now well equipped to reach for my aforementioned goals. However, those goals are unlikely to be met if I continue to spend time with such regular blogging; I do not write about a specific subject or have a well established history of sharing via link blogging, or have any real access to the type of material about which I could write and thus gain traction with any sort of audience.</p>

<p>&hellip; and there it is. I want to make things <em>for people</em>. I believe the world is better when we all try to contribute to it and right now I wish to do so directly, with intention. This means posting my general, mixed blog is purely for me as a hobby, which again is great but for me unfortunately little more than excessive; a thing that has the potential to <em>drag me down</em> as it were.</p>

<p>And so my blog, this very site, will be for the longer form writing and that is fine.</p>

<p>However, there is still microblogging. Those short posts for which my favourite social media platform is named; Micro.blog. Everything about the platform is great&hellip; well, almost great. I recently <a href="https://blog.simonwoods.online/2018/12/07/my-microblog-wishlist.html">posted my wishlist for the platform</a> and have come to realise my main issue can be summed up in a word: friction. There&rsquo;s just too much of it still, be it foundational issues such as the lack of cross-platform apps, cross-platform parity, or a lack clear messaging about how it is safer than mainstream social media platforms&hellip; I still wouldn&rsquo;t recommend Micro.blog for the average person and so it is not quite <em>great</em>.</p>

<p>Then there is mainstream social media, specifically Twitter and Instagram. Flawed though they are, I have <a href="https://blog.simonwoods.online/2018/06/02/where-people-are.html">written previously about the reality that they are where people are</a>; within contexts that are important for my life this is simply true and remains so to this day. There is also another thing; they are relatively free of friction, to enough of an extent to matter.</p>

<p>To this end, a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Br84ELAg0-p/">recent post on Instagram by Federico Viticci</a> caught my eye. He is effectively <em>blogging on Instagram</em>. I guess Instagram is photoblogging by another name anyway but I had never thought much about it also as a general purpose blogging tool. Yet there it is, again, relatively friction free.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a similar story across mainstream social media:</p>

<p>Tap -&gt; tap -&gt; tap -&gt; done. Boom; on with your day.</p>

<p>This ought to be one of the big aims for Micro.blog. Not necessarily <em>as</em> friction-free but much closer to that point than it is at the moment. I believe this is possible, likely to happen, and the true moment when I can thoroughly attempt to convince people I know on a day-to-day basis to give the platform a try as a replacement for whatever social media platforms they are using.</p>

<p>A lot of these thoughts have come in the midst of a deep desire to finally push on and maintain the momentum gained from a particularly <em>busy</em> year. Cutting away excess, minimising friction for hobbies and side projects, and thus making tangible contributions through my work is the path I am taking&hellip; as a result, I will continue to think about such matters as I have written about here, make the relevant decisions, and update my blog as I do so.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>It&rsquo;s been&hellip; well, one hell of a year. There are plenty of things I can&rsquo;t remember right now and that&rsquo;s OK; if it&rsquo;s important enough I&rsquo;ll remember it and make a note. In fact, I&rsquo;ve been advised by more than one person to start a diary and I&rsquo;m looking forward to doing just that.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;m currently feeling it is anticipation; after taking a break, I&rsquo;ll be back on my bullshit and determined to take on all kinds of projects, as well as shoring up my basic organisation of various tasks so that I can use more of my time to do actual work. The improved use of my time will also grant me the chance to rediscover some hobbies, which now feels like a thing I ought to be better at prioritising.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have much else to say, so here are some recent updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deactivated my Now page.

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s been a great writing exercise over the past year, and has helped me with regard to making decisions about exactly what I want my blog to be, the degree to which I am involved in mainstream social media, and more. I thoroughly recommend it.<br /></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Edited menu links.

<ul>
<li>This now better reflects my thinking about this site. It will change if certain features are implemented on Micro.blog but the basic structure is set.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Edited <a href="https://blog.simonwoods.online/about">the About page</a>.

<ul>
<li>This continues to be an ever-changing page but the rate of change has slowed over the past few months, which is good. I would prefer it to be relatively stable, mostly with changes in the future centred around <em>additions</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Moved <a href="https://simonwoods.online">my home page</a> to WordPress.

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s almost done; just missing a single post that I&rsquo;ll have up at some point in January. Tumblr is decaying as part of its life as a social media silo, whilst Micro.blog does not currently have the features I require for this kind of page/site, and I can&rsquo;t afford the other options. Fortunately I won&rsquo;t be blogging at this site so the recent update by Automattic won&rsquo;t be a problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Started contributing to <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog">Micro.blog on GitHub</a>.

<ul>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t done very much yet but a start is better than none. I think this is the best place to focus the various discussions across the community about Micro.blog itself; hopefully this will help make it easier for people to get a good idea of the extent to which Micro.blog is developing and the actual influence the community has on that process.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I have also done some light work on project planning and since stopping regular work a few days ago have found it a lot easier to note down ideas and think about my exact intentions for the next few months. The various parts of my projects are moving forward together nicely and I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting some hobby projects off the ground during my break.</p>

<p>Other than that I am winding down my usual computer-based activity as a whole and will spend more time with both my iPad (reading, video, etc) and my Chromebook (limited functionality means focusing on specific, smaller task), as part of a much more relaxed approach to each day. It&rsquo;s gonna be fun!</p>

<p>With that in mind, this is the last post on Mumblings until next year. Have a fun, safe end to the year everybody. :)</p>

<p>Bye!</p>

<p>What tools are missing? I think it helps to talk about specific feature requests here. The current design is around muting, reporting, and curation of the various sections of Discover.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reply to <a href="https://micro.blog/manton/1446263">Manton&rsquo;s comment</a>:</p>

<p>Similiar to <a href="https://micro.blog/smokey/1450111">Smokey</a>, there are worries about manual curation in the future but that&rsquo;s not a thing I think is worth caring about too much for the rest of us <em>right now</em> since it&rsquo;s mostly theoretical and has too many potential solutions for which it is impossible to know what will definitely be the best approach to take.</p>

<p>Immediately, I think about how Twitter has:</p>

<ul>
<li>Quality filter. When I switched this on it made my timeline <em>so much better</em>. Is the Micro.blog version of this the aforementioned Safe Replies? If so, I have missed the detail on that but even so would suggest that gets promoted a lot more.</li>
<li>Keyword filters. Given the chance, you can really go deep with this and stay ahead of some of the worst offenders; people for whom dealing with is a struggle for even a team of community managers, not least because they are often part of a team themselves (4chan, etc).</li>
<li>Private mode. You can switch this on if things are getting bad, you need to take a break from using the platform, you are unable to keep an eye on things, or you want a <em>personal</em> timeline as well as a public timeline.</li>
<li>Per-person re-tweet setting. I know re-posting doesn&rsquo;t exist on Micro.blog but right now people are already posting to the timeline with a variety of posts, they just happen to be manually created and not actually built into Micro.blog itself. But I can&rsquo;t filter those out.</li>
<li>Blocking. When signed into my timeline certain people simply don&rsquo;t exist.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m pretty sure a bunch of that list is either already sorted &ndash; for example, muting vs blocking is largely semantics and technical differences &ndash; or simply not needed due to the structural differences between Micro.blog and Twitter.</p>

<p>If so then I guess the main issue is exactly that I <em>don&rsquo;t know that the tools are in fact not missing</em> and other than reading through <a href="https://help.micro.blog">Help</a> have no way to know; don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am happy to see people promote Micro.blog independently (I mean, duh, <a href="https://til.micro.blog">of course I do right?</a>) but my feeling wth moderation is that it should be almost <em>too</em> obvious these problems are already solved/impossible to encounter; to be perhaps as clear as I should have been all along: Micro.blog should be <em>yelling</em> about this, as it is a signal to many potential <strong>power users</strong> that the platform is ready for them right now.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://simonwoods.online/2018/12/16/why-i-made.html">Why I Made Today I Learned</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://simonwoods.online/2018/12/16/why-i-made.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-12-16 03:21:50 &#43;0000">Dec 16, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In September of 2017 I had encountered a dilemma. The one all-encompassing hobby project to which I had committed everything I had available outside of my job was no longer feasible. Between the cost, energy, and time it had become a project desperately in need of a team to run it; unfortunately that was not forthcoming, not to the necessary standard and so by mid-October the project came to an end.</p>

<p>Gone. Just like that. More than seven years of my non-job life no longer evident in full public view.</p>

<p>It was strange, not least since things had become steadily worse leading up to this event and so in some ways I had already come to terms with the situation, although to this day I still regret that the project is gone and can never come back. There was a lot in that project, a website centred around creativity and community, that had taken me from my last typical day job through the chaotic first years of becoming a full-time carer. And now it was gone.</p>

<p>Needless to say I had a <em>lot</em> of energy and time now at my disposal, especially once I had taken a good two-week break to recover from such a significant event, and the first thing to come to mind was settling a question that had come often to my thoughts in the preceding years;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can I just write?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have written across different subjects in different ways onto different places across the web for a number of years, so much so that it feels odd to think of a time before I did it. The core of the aforementioned project was writing; I met my wife <em>because</em> of writing; my favourite hobbies have always involved writing, even if I do not partake. Thus the question was inevitable, since I no longer had a central project into which I could pour all of my writing energy.</p>

<p>Actually that&rsquo;s not true.</p>

<p><em>Almost</em> all of it.</p>

<p>You see, I have <em>always</em> dabbled in various writing-based hobbies and in the end the only constant was blogging. Whether it was a personal blog or in some other form, the act of blogging just&hellip; works for me. There&rsquo;s no other way around it; it&rsquo;s what I like doing, it&rsquo;s what primarily drew me to the silos of mainstream social media, and eventually, away from them.</p>

<p>The answer was thus inevitable; I wanted <em>my</em> site, for <em>my</em> blogging, made clearly by <em>my</em> hand. No, not the whole site, just the actual blogging. The core of it all.</p>

<p>This meant considering my options and inevitably deciding WordPress was the best way to go. It just makes sense, right?</p>

<p>Only, no, not really. Of my web-based hobbies one of my favourites is technology. Not just phones or computers but web tech also, and given that the most proficient and well organised independent writers in tech lean very much in the direction of Apple, well, that&rsquo;s where that hobby found a place. Everything from the blogs, to the news sites, to the podcasts, Twitter feeds, and more! Suddenly there was this backlog of <em>years</em> worth of fanatical people about whom I previously had no idea even existed.</p>

<p>Of course, this was <em>before</em> the project ended, by a couple of years. The specifics of the path I travelled upon to arrive to this collection of people, these connected communities, is not that important but needless to say I now had a <em>lot</em> more time and energy to fully invest my time in getting to know the people within the communities and further indulge my interests.</p>

<p>Inevitably the focus of my interests landed mostly on two people: John Gruber and John Siracusa. I&rsquo;m just that way (you know, the same way as so many other people). By way of the various outlets through which the pair would express themselves and contribute to the tech communities I came across Manton Reece, a man engaged in such independently centred ventures that I could not help but take notice. There are links at the bottom of this post to better illustrate some of the timeline here and exactly why Manton&rsquo;s work and words spoke to me strongly enough to wait.</p>

<p>You see, I wanted to blog and do it on my site, and <em>now</em> was the time! However, Manton was close to launching an initiative I had come across thanks to the aforementioned Mr. Gruber; Micro.blog. It was everything I was looking for, maybe&hellip; possibly. I wasn&rsquo;t totally sure but I knew I wanted to try it for sure. But I did not have access &ndash; I certainly threw down my email address to join the queue for getting in &ndash; and would have to wait.</p>

<p>So I wrote. I wasn&rsquo;t posting so much but I was certainly writing, blogging even, and thinking about it, and planning it&hellip; I was blogging in all but publishing. Quickly enough this changed, however, when I finally got access to Micro.blog and within ten minutes knew I wanted to do this, no matter how it might turn out.</p>

<p>Then a month passed and I felt stronger about it. Then some more weeks passed and I blogged and got more involved talking with people whom I had never previously spoken to. Then I started planning something more involved, something more than just blogging.</p>

<p>Unfortunately reality hit, specifically with regard to needing to tighten our financial belt and so the costs of my site were removed and I left Micro.blog. I returned briefly with a free WordPress hosted site plugged into my Micro.blog account but fortunately it wasn&rsquo;t long until I was able to fully return, only this time I decided to go all-in with Micro.blog. Now it was the host for my <em>whole site</em>.</p>

<p>I had launched my planned project just before having to temporarily cancel my accounts; <em>Today I Learned</em> had become public and much to my annoyance and deep shame it became immediately inactive, as a neglected project with no notice. However, my planning continued privately and I was renewed by a sense of urgency upon my return to hosted Micro.blog.</p>

<p>For me any venture about which I care a great deal is only worth my time and energy if it is for more than <em>just me</em>. I truly believe we are all at our best, as communities and societies, when we <strong>share</strong> that which we have. And I believed in Micro.blog, in not just its potential but for what it could do <strong>right now</strong>. Since I believed Today I Learned could help people share Micro.blog, I thus believed Today I Learned was worth most of my spare energy, time, and any resources I could muster.</p>

<p>It is vital that we have time for each other, that we treat and are treated with care in such a way as to presume the best and wish to teach the most. If there are resources, even beyond that which might be available via official sources, and they are made available, worked on over time, improved constantly, and renewed by new ideas therein then I think a project has a great chance of achieving the goals for which it has been created.</p>

<p>Here it is then, my ongoing effort to contribute to Micro.blog in a form beyond my individual blogging and cheerleading; <a href="https://til.micro.blog">Today I Learned</a>, an unofficial resource for Micro.blog.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>This is partially in reply to <a href="https://cleverdevil.io/2018/microblog-suggestion-for-manton-and-crew">Jonathan LaCour&rsquo;s tagmoji suggestion</a> and about the issue in general, since I&rsquo;ve seen other people talk about it in the typically shallow way so many of us seem only capable of doing so.</p>

<p>Whilst it is important to avoid making it easy for people to be abused on Micro.blog, I think &ldquo;improve diversity&rdquo; is a rather shallow demand made with perhaps good intention but very little thought. We need to look deeper, at how our chosen web platforms work and the things we can do to substantially move away from a monoculture without falling into tokenism and other such behaviour.</p>

<p>First, before all else, Micro.blog needs to have a robust set of moderation tools. When even super priveleged white tech dudes are talking about how they have noticed a lack of moderation tools as compared to Twitter, then you know there is a fundamental flaw that needs to be addressed. I&rsquo;m not joking here; a <em>lot</em> of people compliment Micro.blog with comments like &ldquo;it reminds me of the early days of Twitter/Tumblr!&rdquo; and guess what, it was in those early days those platforms <strong>utterly failed</strong> to prepare for the inevitable decline into savagery employed by hateful people.</p>

<p>We are in the early days of Micro.blog; <strong>now</strong> is when we decide the hard work of future-proofing against problems we see elsewhere is not just worth it but one of our top priorities. The platform already has issues having been founded in the white tech monoculture of the US and other white Western countries, against which Jean has already worked with manual curation of the community but it is also up to us, the community itself, to push things forward; we have the freedom of non-VC demands but also the constraints of fewer resources and so must dig in and help where possible.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about different things, different people, different cultures, <em>speak with</em> people who aren&rsquo;t already a part of our lives, and never be afraid to read criticism without becoming defensive and deciding that &ldquo;the world is too sensitive&rdquo; or some other nonsense.</p>

<p>Since a part of Micro.blog&rsquo;s built-in monoculture is being so Apple-heavy, let&rsquo;s take their marketing seriously and <strong>actually think differently</strong>.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A few things for you:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://brewster.kahle.org/2018/02/25/big-data-versus-humanity/">Big Data versus Humanity</a>. Brewster Kahle wrote this in February but it has become even more relevant with each passing day. We shouldn&rsquo;t forget those who built the frameworks of our digital world, not when they&rsquo;re still talking about it today.</li>
<li><a href="https://dori.micro.blog/2018/12/01/one-of-the.html">Frustrations at the IndyWeb conference</a>. Dori Smith thinks those involved with the IndieWeb ought to reach out to Tumblr users in particular, and it makes perfect sense. Up until the past few years Tumblr remained unique within the silos as it continued to embrace blogs, RSS, and the like.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/12/03/microblog-milestone-first.html">Micro.blog milestone: first year open to the public</a>. Manton Reece has maintained and continuously improved the various aspects of the platform, whilst the community has proven that you do <em>not</em> need to have your hand held by a closed, hostile system to have an online life.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/algorithms-dont-see/">Algorithms Don&rsquo;t See</a>. Speaking of the Micro.blog community, Patrick Rhone is a frequent contributor with gems such as this piece in which he succinctly underlines why an inhuman approach to curating the web is simply not good enough.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw/status/1053648947007361024">The web in 2018</a> (<a href="https://imgur.com/EoNd3ev">original link</a>) is a brilliant gif shared by Andy Bell. Website UX being sacrificed for cheap ad rates and lazy marketing has clearly been no solution at all to the challenges of the modern web.</li>
<li><a href="https://annie.micro.blog/2018/11/04/i-have-a.html">A Small Hymn in Praise of My Body</a>. Annie Mueller is another member of the Micro.blog community, and yet another person whose words are worthy of reading by anybody. This post has taken residence in my mind and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be going anywhere for some time yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://micro.inessential.com/2018/12/03/why-write-about.html">Why write about lunch?</a> Why yes, Brent Simmons <em>is</em> on Micro.blog. Huh, funny that! In this short posts he hits a number of great points in answering the stated question.</li>
<li><a href="https://gabytron.me/2018/12/04/are-there-any.html">Are there any rules?</a> Another great question from yet another member of the Micro.blog community. Luis Gabriel Santiago Alvarado has gradually returned to blogging over the past year and with posts like this it&rsquo;s easy to see why. <a href="https://micro.blog/Gaby/1265974">You can answer his question, if you like</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.restlesslens.me/2018/12/07/working-around-the.html">Pretty Damn Futuristic</a>. Jeremy has found, like me, AirPods to be pretty damn good. <em>Especially</em> when used within the Apple ecosystem.</li>
<li><a href="https://xkcd.com/1361/">Randall Munroe&rsquo;s excellent comic immediately came to mind</a> the moment I came across the latest news about Google Hangouts and Allo.</li>
<li><a href="https://thetruesize.com">The True Size</a> is an excellent web app to help you keep check of your mental model of the world, made by James Talmage and Damon Maneice who were in turn inspired by <em>The West Wing</em> which in itself is often a very good thing indeed.

<li><a href="https://ramblinggit.com/2018/11/populism-and-todays-social-tech-vs-blogging/">Populism and Today&rsquo;s Social Tech vs. Blogging</a>. Brad Enslen is hitting out of the park again with his thinking on the web, starting with this first part of a series.</li>
<li><a href="https://indieseek.xyz/links/index.php?TID=pages-linktous">Indieseek Directory</a>. Speaking of Brad, he is building a directory of his own to which you can link or even add its search to your site. Efforts like this are how we rebuild the web and move it away from the centralised, silo behemoths.</li>

Mandaris Moore is doing a great thing for the holiday season, with yet another brilliant contribution to the Micro.blog community. You <a href="https://micro.blog/mandaris/1222550">can talk to him about it on Micro.blog</a>!</li>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have been taking notes for this wishlist for some time. Two things have stopped me from writing it up and posting:</p>

<ol>
<li>Time and energy. I have spent more of it on <a href="https://til.micro.blog/2018/11/23/updates-recent.html">making</a> <a href="https://blog.simonwoods.online/archive/">other</a> <a href="https://firebyrduk.wordpress.com/">things</a>, being a believer in the idea that the best position from which to criticise is that of creation, or put another way: I feel much more comfortable writing a critique-based wishlist for Micro.blog now that I&rsquo;ve significantly increased my exposure to working on different projects.</li>
<li>Frankly, Manton, Jean, and John have all worked their arses off to improve Micro.blog in a variety of ways. Not only have I been able to remove items from the list but I have also been exposed to ideas for Micro.blog I had not previously come near to thinking about.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now here I am, not only more convinced of just how right the entire idea of Micro.blog truly is &ndash; after all, it&rsquo;s not just about Micro.blog but the potential in ideas similar to the platform insofar as sharing the same ideals &ndash; but also newly motivated to attempt to make a constructive contribution. As such, here is the list:</p>

<p>(<em>Note:</em> I have published three posts around this subject, all of which play a part in the list. Links: <a href="https://blog.simonwoods.online/2018/04/18/quick-microblog-wishlist.html">Quick list</a>; <a href="https://blog.simonwoods.online/2018/08/31/what-microblog-needs.html">Needs</a>; <a href="https://blog.simonwoods.online/2018/09/23/microblog-thoughts-thereon.html">Thoughts</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li>Comprehensive support of features centred around accessibility;

<ul>
<li>Easier <code>alt</code> tags, VoiceOver support, and a robust editor are some of the necessary pieces to making Micro.blog as accessible as possible.</li>
<li>Some improvements were recently made on iOS.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Thorough user moderation;

<ul>
<li>The ability to control as much of your timeline as possible is essential to making Micro.blog a viable space in which people can comfortably invest their time and energy.</li>
<li>Earlier this year the web and Mac apps gained muting and reporting tools.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Multi-account support on the web.</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts;

<ul>
<li><em>ctrl+enter to post</em>, etc. The lack of these options on the web is jarring, especially in a post editor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mentions;

<ul>
<li>When replying in a thread, you ought to be given the option to reply-all or not.</li>
<li>Autofill when typing a username.</li>
<li>Autofill has come to iOS, when creating new posts.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Help;

<ul>
<li>Add search. This has been mitigated by the recently improved homepage but over time a search box will become necessary for most people.</li>
<li>Further additions from other sources &ndash; ex: <a href="http://www.manton.org/2017/10/micro-blog-special-pins.html">this &lsquo;pins&rsquo; post from Manton</a> &ndash; which has already happened a little.</li>
<li>Make sure the breadth of blog-centred web is covered.</li>
<li>For example: self-hosted WordPress, hosted WP, multisite WP, shared hosting WP.</li>
<li>WP has the potential to lack compatibility due to different hosts implementing their own version for whatever reason.</li>
<li>Micro.blog should, even if gradually, cover more and more of this ground until everything is up-to-date and quickly updated whenever different versions of WP are updated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Broadly;

<ul>
<li>Where possible, all of these updates should be available to third-party apps.</li>
<li>The web MUST be the canonical version. App-centric approaches are in direct opposition to any substantial support of the open web, <em>especially</em> when they are Apple-only efforts, mostly due to the cost barrier.</li>
<li>This year has seen <em>a lot</em> of improvements to the web app, which is great! Long may it continue.</li>
<li><em>Example of Apple-centric approach</em>: the Micro.blog home page for logged-out visitors has a screenshot of the Mac App.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>There might be things I&rsquo;m missing but there is one glaring omission; Android. I have mentioned the Apple-heavy support of Micro.blog but not listed Android, or any other platform. The reality is an official Android app is all but impossible in the current circumstances, whilst third-party efforts are ongoing but appear to be particularly difficult to implement; this is of course not at all exclusive to Micro.blog but remains a fact even so.</p>

<p>Windows and even Linux support have also been spoken about by developers but for now the web is the answer for those of us outside of Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem, and I believe some of the items on my list would further soften the blow that is a lack of cross-native app support.</p>

<p>Micro.blog recently hit <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/12/03/microblog-milestone-first.html">the first year of public release</a> and it is fair to say it has come a <em>long</em> way in those 12 months, let alone the progress Manton has made from the earliest days of the Kickstarter project. I for one have found <em>just</em> the right place for my life online, to such an extent that I now begrudgingly use the mainstream silos of the web for work and do everything I can to avoid them in a personal context. For that reason and that reason alone I have spent plenty of my time on <a href="https://micro.blog/simonwoods">the timeline</a>, <a href="https://blog.simonwoods.online">my hosted site</a>, <a href="https://photos.simonwoods.online">my new photoblog</a>, and <a href="https://micro.blog/til">Today I Learned</a>.</p>

<p>And, like Micro.blog itself, I&rsquo;m just getting started.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. iTunes on Windows + iPod = my only exposure to Apple previous to the stage in my life when I actively got involved with the Apple enthusiast community, and those two things made a lasting impression.</p>

<p>In fact, earlier this year I tried going all-in on Google, Android phone, the works, and that included not just dumping Apple Music but also iTunes; in the end, every other music player grated on me and that was in comparison to iTunes <em>for Windows</em>. Things have become bad enough overall that I have now returned to my goal of attempting to go all-in with Apple, starting with AirPods (they&rsquo;re <em>fucking awesome</em>) and the 2018 iPad.</p>

<p>With moves like this Apple could build up a buffer of goodwill and for sure help themselves with future mistakes; the past few years has seen most of the heavy criticism aimed at the company come <em>after</em> other mistakes and missteps were made. Too much negative momentum has built up over time and making as many steps into cross-platform waters as they can will likely help negate that momentum, even if only as a starting point in the effort to do so.</p>

<p>I really think hosted Micro.blogs need an on-blog comment system so non-blogging friends can comment. If you are coming from FB, you can tell your friends about RSS readers and keeping in touch, but if they can‚Äôt converse with you it‚Äôs all for nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ndash; <a href="https://rantinggit.com/2018/11/28/i-really-think.html">Brad Enslen</a></p>

<p>If it worked with webmentions and the like then sure, even still that would mean needing to prompt people to get that set up for themselves &ndash; the infrastructure for this already exists through Micro.blog accounts and IndieWeb custom domain usernames &ndash; which flies in the face of that which people have been trained; easy, frictionless, embedded, centralised.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think closed Micro.blog commenting (like WordPress comments) does much to change enough of the existing problems with commenting systems; as one of the stated goals for Micro.blog is to encourage people to own the things they post, I&rsquo;m not sure <em>ease of use</em> is a strong enough factor to encourage such a thing. Also, if it was done similar to WordPress comments we get back to the point where it&rsquo;s down to the person running the blog to manage comments &ndash; personally, I&rsquo;d rather take a walk in traffic &ndash; and invariably includes the complications inherent therein; aside from anything else it often looks cluttered and unintuitive.</p>

<p>If the option to display comments comes to hosted sites a good first step might be the aforementioned messaging to encourage people to use their own domain or a Micro.blog account for commenting. Beyond that, I think it&rsquo;s a case of waiting for other commenting systems based around similar ideals to surface; the open web, ownership, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>Although, if Micro.blog commenting were to become that in and of themselves I wouldn&rsquo;t complain. I mean, I would be shocked to see such a thing since, seriously, there is no skeevy VC money here or soul-destroying <em>monetisation</em> through which Micro.blog could gain a team and work at the level required to also build a separate, complimentary commenting system.</p>

<p>&ndash; <a href="https://micro.blog/JohnPhilpin/1172255">John Philpin</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about the best they&rsquo;ve ever done&hellip; I&rsquo;m talking about the <em>bottom standard</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The relative lack of movement with regard to hardware updates.</li>
<li>Further dumbing down their own software for no discernible reason&hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; <em>whilst</em> making clumsy changes that affect third-party developers badly.</li>
<li>Ramping up prices overall.

<ul>
<li>Not just premium but an actual <em>fuck you</em> to all but the wealthy few who care.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The utter failure in managing optics for their messes &ndash; the &ldquo;PRIVACY TECH COMPANY THAT CARES&rdquo; <em>cannot</em> be forgiven for <em>failures in optics</em>.</li>
<li>&hellip; and the stupid book, the ridiculous fuck ups with leaks, the iPhone battery bullshit.</li>
</ul>

<p>I mean, <em>come on</em>. Of course they have always fucked up, that&rsquo;s to be expected since <em>people run these companies</em> but Jobs set a platform and Tim Cook has missed a great chance to create a <em>cavernous</em> difference in quality and stability between them and the competition, a <strong>true and undeniable justification for the premium label</strong>.</p>

<p>Now of course, I am an outsider (I have an iPad and AirPods &ndash; both of which are brilliant) who has listened to a bunch of Apple tech podcasts and read Apple punditry for the past few years. If over the next year, as I get more Apple hardware and immerse myself further into their ecosystem, things aren&rsquo;t as bad as they seem (see: the list above) then great, turns out perception does not match reality. At that point, despite the failings of the people in my position I will <em>still</em> lay some of the blame at Apple&rsquo;s feet; too many times when they engage in any sort of PR action it is either neutral to the point of irrelevant or so clumsy you&rsquo;d think they were a bunch of young idiots running their first company, and <em>that</em> is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Apple has already decided they can just do all of the app-focused editorial in-house. How long before they start scooping up app developers and signficantly increase the number of first-party apps?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not at all confident the average iPhone buyer (i.e. Apple&rsquo;s most valuable customer) could care less about third-party apps and so find it difficult to see them receiving real pushback for that kind of move.</p>

         	<p>I recently stumbled across <a href="https://snarfed.org/2018-09-04_i-dont-hang-out-on-the-internet"><em>I don&rsquo;t hang out on the internet</em></a> by Ryan Barrett and it hit a few marks for me, in different ways. One of the most significant effects being on the web has had on me is to ask a question: How much of this do you want?</p>

<p>My primary use of the web was to connect with people, much like Ryan explained, as a young adult looking for like-minded people. However, my relationship with the web has transformed to the point where I now feel as if I have both feet in different worlds; on one hand I adore the web enthusiast community &ndash; open web, IndieWeb, Micro.blog, etc &ndash; not least because without that collective behaviour it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine the web would be relevant at all; on the other hand I love seeing non-web enthusiasts take part of their physical lives and share it with, well, more people than was previously possible. I connect in many ways with both sets of people and the intensity of my preference changes depending on a number of factors, not least of which is my mood.</p>

<p>However, the problem is the toll this can have on my energy and time, and frankly, on my mental health. Of course, &ldquo;Just take a break!&rdquo; is great advice and it&rsquo;s always important to take a step back from any particular activity, even if only once in a while. I need more than that; my goal to work remotely requires focus, organised time, restraint; is that possible whilst investing time in a number of enthusiast activities? I&rsquo;m convinced it is not.</p>

<p>The choice is therefore: what do I cut? Over the next couple of months I&rsquo;ll be making difficult decisions with this, as the majority of middle-aged people also seem to do so.</p>

<p>Well&hellip; I have at least experienced all kinds of different joy in the process of indulging in a variety of interests and passions over the past several years. Things could have been much worse.</p>

         	<p>This is a previous version of my <em>About</em> page on my hosted Micro.blog site:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simon Woods is a man of dubious taste with little to no skill for effectively managing time, space, or any other dimension. He also likes to use words incorrectly, if for nothing else than the exquisite joy of seeing people care enough to get annoyed about it. There‚Äôs also a chance that doing the ‚Äòwords‚Äô thing is difficult and laziness feels so damned good. He‚Äôs lucky enough to live with Claire Field, an infinitely patient and dizzyingly talented fianc√©e, in a city that is known for a collection of insects who continue to be quite popular many years after their death. Every day is made even better by the company of two cats, one of a delicate nature and the other of a kind you are likely to see with the Muppets.</p>

<p>The effort to work is often characterised by an inability to make substantial progress one way or the other but Simon has at least improved his ability to recognise this in a practical manner. There are points when it seems best to give up but then life wouldn‚Äôt be very interesting without challenges, and so he perseveres. To this day it is likely his most impressive achievement.</p>

<p>For those who have taken the time to read this he apologises. Please know that it was excruciating to write.</p>

<p>Especially the three paragraphs before this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&hellip; I was, uh, trying something. If it taught me one thing it&rsquo;s that I much prefer to write creatively within the context of specific projects, especially when it comes to writing fiction.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still thinking a lot about my pages and my blog and how it all fits together; I&rsquo;m leaning towards having a single page as a better representation for both what I am now doing <em>and</em> what I am aiming to do. The question now is: how do I create such a page?</p>

<p>I have a custom domain &ndash; whilst I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;d like to thank <a href="https://manton.org">Manton</a> for introducing me to the idea that as long as you have your domain, the guts of the site are largely irrelevant; it has clarified my thinking <em>a whole fucking lot</em> &ndash; so I think I&rsquo;ll start with something that&rsquo;s free and then upgrade later when possible, should there be something else I need from such a site.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have tweaked both my <a href="http://simonmumbles.micro.blog/about/">current About page</a> and <a href="http://simonmumbles.micro.blog/feeds/">my Subscribe page</a>.</p>

<p>Also, I just <a href="http://til.micro.blog/2018/11/23/updates-recent.html">released a bunch of updates</a> for <a href="https://micro.blog/til">@til</a> and now I&rsquo;m ready to ramp up my efforts on other projects. As I <a href="https://simonmumbles.micro.blog/2018/10/14/autumn-falls.html">previously mentioned</a> my blogging quantity will decrease but in place of that I will produce higher quality, focused work. My ability to do this has in fact been jump-started by my renewed blogging over the past year, which is another thing for which I can thank Manton Reece; seriously dude, you both got more blogging from me <em>and</em> helped me find the focus required to make hard decisions&hellip; for that, I can&rsquo;t thank you enough.</p>

<p>There are times when it becomes easy to forget the things we do for each other as people. Right now it is important for me remember that Manton, Jean, and the whole Micro.blog community has done for me that which I truly needed. Thank you all. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

         	<p>One of my reasons for feeling trepidation at giving Apple a try beyond iPhone and iPad is that there is <strong>no</strong> cheaper option to try. There is no entry-level model; this is simply not something Apple are interested in offering to people.</p>

<p>So if I run into <a href="https://twitter.com/syneryder/status/1066258885923635200">similar problems to that which Kohan Ikin has experienced</a> I&rsquo;ll be pretty well screwed. After saving for a computer for months and then relying on it to get work done, they would basically have me by the balls and only create <em>more</em> stress of a kind that is damaging in different ways.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just use what you&rsquo;ve got&rdquo; or &ldquo;Just get another computer&rdquo; you might say; right, fair enough, but I am already using what I have got &ndash; which, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, is quite good &ndash; and the fact is that I am talking about my <em>livelihood</em> here, not just something to fart around on with the browser and email and shitty games or something. The change to the Mac might not actually work; it might be the case that I prefer Windows but even then just to <em>try</em> the Mac there is still this potential for more stress than I am sure I have the capacity with which to deal.</p>

<p>Damn it. Technology needs to hurry up and become better overall and more accessible.</p>

<p>John is as concerned as I am with regard to the depth of vile incompetence at which both the Big Tech and political entities of our societies are allowed to operate at, <em>and</em> continue to thrive in the process.</p>

<p>The one thing that continues to surprise me is just <em>how surprised</em> so many online commenters are about this; as if corruption has not been at the heart of our so-called democracies for, well, <em>ever</em>.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing commenters can do, especially with the reach of Kottke and the like, is help build the alternatives and shine a light on the ways in which things can be improved. I understand that what&rsquo;s in the news is what gets people&rsquo;s eyeballs but at some point we all have to be accountable for improvement rather than mere observation.</p>

<p>&ndash; <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/11/15/breaking-up-facebook.html">Manton Reece, <em>Breaking up Facebook is up to us</em></a></p>

<p>One of the things that always keeps me away from going back to the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; option of <em>just</em> using social media is the reminder that the same people who like to brag about &ldquo;indpendent thought&rdquo; and &ldquo;independent speech&rdquo; also use Facebook heavily for promotion and the like. A platform that so readily allows this illogical behaviour to thrive, and cause so much destruction, is never a platform any actual independently motivated person ought to invest in let alone trust.</p>

<p>I look forward to the continued growth of a diverse, independent ecosystem of <em>small</em> and flexible platforms to replace mainstream social media. Now more than ever we need the people making these platforms to understand that people do use these big platforms for real, practical reasons and the only way to move power away from such deeply flawed platforms is to provide <em>usable</em> alternatives.</p>

<p>We are only at the beginning of these efforts but speed is of the essence; the mainstream platforms hold sway over enough of the right people to damage the lives of millions of people, and those of us privileged enough to be born into the ill-gotten wealth of the tech-heavy Western world <em>must</em> lead the charge for higher standards across the board.</p>
