			 <p>Vincent Ritter, <a href="https://vincentritter.com/2024/06/03/an-introduction-to-sublime-feed">introducing Sublime Feed</a> makes a point that feels like it was just for me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also no concept of &ldquo;unread&rdquo;. I don‚Äôt need that in my life&hellip; and I know some of you do. I think having an unread count isn‚Äôt healthy. Each time you load up your feed it‚Äôs a snapshot of this very moment in time and you can just pick and choose. I think it‚Äôs easy enough to remember the post you just read and move onto the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with this, mostly. Given that I&rsquo;ve given up on remembering every little thing, Sublime Feed will be a place in which I will only read my favourites.</p>

			 <p>In <a href="https://craney.fyi/2024/03/17/my-son-has.html">Manners Maketh Man</a>, Davey Craney states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This bitter growing rumbling spiteful hosepiped rage directed towards these truly inconsequential matters. Imagine the multitude of ways this bitter buffon could channel his energy better within his day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I largely agree. However, the word &ldquo;growing&rdquo; caught my eye.</p>
<p>Davey, I like a lot of what you have written here. Regarding the position of &ldquo;nowadays&rdquo; and &ldquo;the political landscape&rdquo;, though, I have to disagree. I see a lot of this viewpoint ‚Äî to me it&rsquo;s similar to the mentality that leads to making things great again ‚Äî and I can hardly ever agree.</p>
<p>What made the multiple bad experiences I had in service 20 years ago happen? Or, more importantly, when my cousin was racially abused as a child <em>by other children</em>? Did somebody travel back in time from now and poison the well? Nah I don&rsquo;t think so. Instead, I think this is just looking for patterns where there are none; seeking certainty because, as an animal, we <em>hate</em> uncertainty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy you happen to have the right mix of personhood to handle stress and disappointment in such a cordial manner; not only do I strive, as you do, to always maintain my composure in this way I also believe we&rsquo;d all be better off if everybody attempted to do so. However I do think it&rsquo;s important to remember that not everybody is the same and that&rsquo;s ok. An assertion that your way is undeniably correct seems a little short-sighted, given the vast differences in the lives of people even on our tiny island ‚Äî again, I am happy for you but I see a lot of this viewpoint as well and I&rsquo;m not comfortable with casting aspersions in this way.</p>
<p>Your view seems to be &ldquo;This happened to me? Things must be getting bad.&rdquo; and that idea makes complete sense when looking to make order out of the chaos of life. I&rsquo;m not convinced, though, that it&rsquo;s a particularly helpful way to process these events.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably missing your specific, nuanced point; it just caught my eye in the way I&rsquo;ve seen some of the more generalised aspects of these issues presented by others. And I struggle to reconcile that with my own experiences, overall.</p>

<p>Excellent work. Raising the visibility and ease of access to OPML files strengthens web feeds as an alternative to silo feeds.</p>
<p>I was looking into creating OPML files for <a href="https://micro.blog/TIL">@TIL</a>; I&rsquo;m still going to do so, only now I do not need to wait until I have accomplished this to launch related features. Instead, I&rsquo;ll immediately use this MB mechanism for those features.</p>

			 <p>I wrote <a href="https://swoods.net/2024/03/05/muted-somebody-on.html">a short post</a> which I&rsquo;m half-regretting and was then inspired by <a href="https://swoods.net/2024/03/05/muted-somebody-on.html">the ensuing conversation</a> to waffle on a bit.</p>
<p>‚ÅÇ</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to become much more careful when talking about this type of thing, not least because MB is in a bit of an odd place; plenty of people are trying to volunteer but the tools to do so are limited, whilst there is no way to know whether such efforts are going to be bolstered by fully-equipped, paid official help.</p>
<p>Whilst I think there is a lot we in the community can talk about regarding these issues and generally have greater interaction to help foster the best environment possible, I also believe a lot of that particular work won&rsquo;t be worth much if the team isn&rsquo;t able to reciprocate in the best way.</p>
<p>This situation might be much better than I believe it to be, and I just haven&rsquo;t been involved enough with conversations that happen elsewhere ‚Äî this is mostly how I see it based on the public spaces for the community.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to better conversations about these issues, especially beyond just text and timelines, and hope to see some of my doubts proven wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am still very much of the same opinion that replacing &ldquo;insert popular social network here&rdquo; with something more open which behaves and looks very similar&hellip; isn&rsquo;t the way. Maybe just me. Thoughts?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, it seems a lot of problems arise for people when they&rsquo;ve confused their personal issues with systemic social structures.</p>
<p>tbh a lot of the hand-wringing I&rsquo;ve seen from people tends to not only be inaccurate but 99% of the time just basic projecting with approximately 0 effort applied to introspection from the individual.</p>
<p>And I mean for <em>all social networks</em>. From the moment I started using the web more than 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Could we do better <em>as a group</em>? Yes, of course ‚Äî this is always true, and the point of existing if we&rsquo;re being honest about it. However the web changed the entire definition of that idea (&ldquo;as a group&rdquo;) and we&rsquo;re still in the earliest stages of that process; it honestly feels like a lot of the criticism or disillusionment is way too harsh for such an early stage.</p>
<p>(edit: the critique I have for &ldquo;hand-wringing&rdquo; I also apply to myself ‚Äî I am never happy when I fall into this trap and work on removing it from my life as much as I can; <a href="https://swoods.net/2024/02/11/its-fair-to.html">our new home already helps</a>)</p>

			 <p>A new feature on Micro.blog inspired <a href="https://micro.blog/patrickrhone/29785166">a discussion</a> over what I think of as the ongoing friction caused by the dual nature of the platform as a paid blogging host, with free(ish) social network attached.</p>
<p>My reply got longer than I like to see in my own timeline so here we go&hellip;</p>
<p>The reason I would prefer to use a different label is that it helps me maintain a sense of place, to be aware of the context. To me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversation = timeline</li>
<li>Replies = blog</li>
</ul>
<p>(Edit: actually, this makes sense now that I&rsquo;ve written it out. <em>Conversation</em> works because that&rsquo;s where the link goes. My question now is: why is there a link to the timeline mixed in with my blog posts?</p>
<p>Maybe this would be easier to understand if Conversation.js was better equipped as a commenting system.)</p>
<p>This tripped me up because it appears to be an ongoing issue; I regularly see lots of people struggle with these ideas and there is no apparent proof of intent from the design side of things ‚Äî what&rsquo;s the idea, why was it done that way, will it change over time, how much does feedback matter in these decisions, etc ‚Äîand I wonder if these choices add to the uncertainty and difficulty? I&rsquo;m probably over-thinking it.</p>

			 <p>The US is a continent that votes in this thing, and the election is ridiculous with regard to mobilised effort; people, money, employed, volunteers, events, etc&hellip; and only one strategy is attempted? Why not do all of this?</p>
<p>idk I&rsquo;m probably not in the best position to judge for the US specifically but I think there are similarities in this country (England). Do you know what happened when progressives last tried to just energise the base? Jeremy Corbin rambled on about obscure policy that <em>literally nobody cared about</em>.</p>
<p>Why are so-called progressives so willing to fall over their own feet with this stuff? Maddening. We&rsquo;re like &ldquo;we care!&rdquo; and then do&hellip; uh, something about it, I guess? Clarity and focus is required, and whilst I agree you shouldn&rsquo;t abandon your base or ignore the supposed non-deciding minority I also find it difficult to believe that we can&rsquo;t do more than one thing.</p>
<p>I would hope that the people involved have this covered, and the strategy involves some degree of establishing priorities ‚Äî you apply x amount of resources to each type; base, non-decided, opposition; and then shift your efforts as the situation develops.</p>
<p>I see an awful lot of &ldquo;ew the other side&rdquo; specifically on the web and it&rsquo;s tiring given how the majority of people all want the same thing: make my life better.</p>
<p>I recall Obama talking about his frustration with this, especially on the internet, in that it seemed to him that too few people on the progressive side of things understood that they were shooting themselves in the foot by getting overly involved in nonsensical tribalism. There are real problems to solve and it never happened without clarity of purpose.</p>

<p>One of the many ways Adam and Manton are quite similar, all within the context of a thing I believe is important:</p>

			 <p>Now a very short way <a href="https://swoods.net/2021/02/19/my-tech-future.html">into the future</a>, an update;</p>
<ul>
<li>a basic phone;</li>
<li>an MP3 player;</li>
<li>[own] maybe a laptop;</li>
<li>[own] a few reliable notebooks;</li>
<li>[own] a selection of analogue watches;</li>
<li>[own] and a camera.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feeling good about the progress I&rsquo;ve made, although at that point I already owned a camera. I am also happy to grow my collection of the bottom three items in particular.</p>
<p>To be clear, since I didn&rsquo;t mention it in my first post these aims are for my personal life in particular. If my work demands use of other hardware and software then I&rsquo;ll use whatever is needed. Given the increasing capabilities of laptops, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if that was all I truly needed for any professional work whilst also giving me the bare necessary access to the digital world I might need for personal use.</p>
<p>Our start to life in Cornwall has been so good that I believe this goal is achievable rather than fanciful, and I look forward to completing the list so that I can put my ideas to the test. That includes expanding on those ideas in some sort of digital public space.</p>

			 <p>Myself, Claire, and the beasties are moving&hellip; again! It&rsquo;s an exciting opportunity, and this time I am freeing up the appropriate space to make it work well. As such any posting here will be sporadic at best.</p>
<p>On this site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://swoods.net/">The home page</a> is now a single-page design with plain text info and a navigation menu.</li>
<li><a href="https://swoods.net/hello">Hello</a> is my new page for an introduction to where I am, why, and the best ways to send me a message.</li>
<li><a href="https://swoods.net/links">Links</a> is my new page for getting quick access to my work and related sites.</li>
<li><a href="https://swoods.net/now">Now</a> is my new page for my current status.</li>
</ul>
<p>Elsewhere, I have a new email address that I am using exclusively for speaking to other folks: <a href="mailto:hi@swoods.net">hi@swoods.net</a> ‚Äî I am happy to receive any and all messages about anything at all.</p>
<p>Also, I have reactivated <a href="https://photos.swoods.net/">my photo blog</a>. This is primarily for <a href="https://challenges.micro.blog/2023/08/30/september-photoblogging-challenge.html">the Micro.blog Photoblogging Challenge</a> but I would love to keep the blog up once that is complete, not least because our new home promises to give us easy access to a variety of awe-inspiring locations.</p>
<p>Finally, as a result of the move, the ensuing chaos, and my determination to mitigate the massive potential for health-endangering stress I am also shelving public updates for TIL. The work will continue where I can fit it in ‚Äî switching to all-laptop computing after almost two years with the desktop should be fun ‚Äî but I cannot justify fitting unpaid work alongside The Move. As with the photoblogging, I am already impatient to get back to full working status on TIL; especially with regard to the imminent updates.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re holding our breath for this move, since it has the potential to be the last time we ever cross county borders for home and as such I cannot wait to get settled into a house in which we can properly commit to an ever-growing list of goals to accomplish and desires to fulfil.</p>
<p>In the meantime I&rsquo;ll see you on the Micro.blog timeline, via email, or elsewhere on the web. üëã</p>

			 <p>So. We&rsquo;re in Cornwall.</p>
<p>It is amazing; even though we&rsquo;ve only been here together on two occasions, both within the past fourteen months, there is no doubt that Claire and I want little more than to settle in this particular place. The West Country is, truly, exactly where we belong.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s weird, partly because one of the reasons we&rsquo;re here is so that Claire can attend part one of an interview ‚Äî we&rsquo;re both nervous and I have full faith that she will give them no reason other than to offer her the position ‚Äî and because it is the first time we have ever deliberately taken time out for a break. This is our first holiday together. It&rsquo;s a short break but when you have not taken one in almost twenty years it feels so very long in the very best way imaginable.</p>
<p>Now, given time away, it has provided me with the chance to prioritise a number of thoughts, ideas, and possibilities that I have been holding back&hellip; or rather, I have provided myself with that chance. Isn&rsquo;t it weird how easy it is to forget that the time we spend is often of our own making?</p>
<p>On top of the many updates due for <a href="https://micro.blog/TIL">@TIL</a>, and the shared stories with Claire, I now realise I need to more seriously create space for my long-form blogging. It&rsquo;s likely that I&rsquo;ll publish the many thoughts and ideas freed to roam by the break, in an effort to &ldquo;work-in-public&rdquo; as I have in the past; a glance at my archives proves that I was once much more open and I can&rsquo;t deny that many parts of daily life were much better during those times, specifically as relates to my wellbeing and consequent effect on everything around me.</p>
<p>&hellip; now that was a ridiculously long sentence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if future posts will be much like this. I intend to be concise when discussing my ideas and thoughts, although maybe that has also changed recently during my long-form drought? I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;</p>

			 <p>The following is mostly in response to <a href="https://micro.blog/JohnPhilpin/18499446">John Philpin&rsquo;s comment in a Micro.blog conversation</a>, specifically the third paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be clear - likely all very theoretical since micro blog is well below the radar, <strong>but it highlights how &lsquo;clarity&rsquo; on MicroBlog, takes work and iterations</strong> - and you can even break the rules and not know üò¨.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(emphasis mine)</p>
<p>If we could find some lost treasure ‚Äî and thus fund an expansions to the Micro.blog team ‚Äî then it would be possible to produce regular mini-versions of the &ldquo;State of Micro.blog&rdquo; session from Micro Camp, focused on how these issues are being tackled on the platform.</p>
<p>I say that because social issues ‚Äî ethics, people, incidents, etc ‚Äî are a moving target that require regular updates and can&rsquo;t be properly accounted for with the &ldquo;just trust us&rdquo; model that has been in use on social platforms for the past twenty years.</p>
<p>For example: <a href="https://twitter.com/rahaeli/status/1594756281650524160">rahaeli&rsquo;s minimum expectations when signing up for a new service</a> could be the type of checklist against which the team&rsquo;s efforts could be regularly self-reported as part of the aforementioned mini-session.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe this kind of thing is already being discussed ‚Äî I know there was an invitation for people to get involved via email last year and I failed to do so ‚Äî and it&rsquo;s all still private at the moment. Either way there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be much going on, in an overtly public manner. Otherwise I don&rsquo;t think there would be a need to ask such questions for the concerns raised in the original thread.</p>

I don‚Äôt know anything about the app they bought, do we know if it is worse than that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‚Äî John Philpin, <a href="https://micro.blog/JohnPhilpin/18001078">in a conversation about Apple&rsquo;s newest app</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;interesting enough to explore&rdquo; is valid in the existing Music app. This is specifically aimed at Classical music for which, as an expert has already <a href="https://gregorypittman.net/2023/03/28/initial-thoughts-on.html">told</a> <a href="https://micro.blog/gdp/18000049">us</a>, metadata is a <em>core feature</em>.</p>
<p>A bad experience with metadata in this app is the definition of junk, since the app is no longer useful. Apple often refuses indie third-party apps for being non-functional (&ldquo;you can&rsquo;t use it without an account&rdquo;, and all that other bullshit) and so it&rsquo;s only fair to hold them to the same standard.</p>
<p>The aforementioned Spotify, along with other companies such as Meta and Uber would be rightfully criticised by you for such a thing. I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re defending such a sloppy release by the so-called premium brand.</p>
<p>As for Primephonic, I was aware it had a good reputation, and <a href="https://www.whathifi.com/reviews/primephonic">if this What Hi-Fi? review</a> is anything to go by it seems like it was well earned. Certainly its customers were upset at being bought by Apple and I don&rsquo;t imagine that&rsquo;s purely based on them being too lazy to try an alternative.</p>
<p>Even so, again, I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s better than Primephonic. This is <em>Apple</em>; the whole point of this company is to be the best no matter what they do. It should be better than Primephonic from the start and get better from there. When it does get better ‚Äî which I hope it does though I don&rsquo;t feel as confident in that as I should ‚Äî I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll deserve praise until it is <em>much</em> better, and even then it should not be forgotten that they should have done a much better job from the start.</p>

<p>‚Äî <a href="https://micro.blog/gdp/18000578">Gregory Pittman</a>, on Apple&rsquo;s Classical Music app.</p>
<p>This sounds awful and yet more reason to focus on locally owned and managed music for anybody who cares even a little bit about having a good experience.</p>

			 <p>In the past year we moved for work (my wife got opportunities that were not available in our previous location) and ended up in a fairly affluent, yet still diverse region; we&rsquo;re lucky in that there is a good mix of accepting technological changes but not excluding stable, traditional methods of, well, most aspects of life.</p>
<p>Given that, I&rsquo;ve noticed that without the distortion field of an immediately nearby major urban centre people are much less inclined to be constantly driven by whatever latest shiny waste of time appears, whether from startups or desperate monopolists. Rather, people observe the wider world at a slower pace than <em>heart-attack-inducing</em> and most often continue to rely on well-established lines of communication; specifically, speak to your neighbours as first priority, care about your local politicians above all else, and so on.</p>
<p>This has helped me to understand certain trends and opinions that I&rsquo;ve observed of people from outside of the tech/web/news bubble that so often dominates and defines online communities. It seems that people have got lives to live, and real changes to make rather than taking up their time screeching at a website.</p>
<p>Overall, this makes me happy. If we&rsquo;re going to make important changes, and generally improve our world as much as possible we need people who are capable of maintaining perspective whilst doing the best they possibly can.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something so human about taking something great, and ruining it a little so you can have more of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, the idea of the big social web and the silos and convenience and everybody on the web altogether&hellip; it all just feels like that quote.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m too cynical but I don&rsquo;t want to see people throw their lives away for this anymore. The web, open and decentralised, can handle virality and all of that; let the networks be smaller, more secure, and given closer attention by actual humans with an emphasis on effort and care as can be seen in smaller physical communities.</p>

<p>Just now, over my morning coffee, I‚Äôve been listening to an album from the 70s, deep in the Era of LPs. Fortyish minutes long, twenty-odd minutes to a side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robert has been considering <a href="https://rnv.letterspace.org/2022/08/06/phrasing.html">the language used between LP and CD</a>, and it immediately made me think of a conversation within this household as of late.</p>
<p>My wife and I have been talking about our plans for music; we&rsquo;re both in agreement that we need to get CDs back into the home, and she even surprised me by suggesting the addition of vinyl. My memories of the latter are much weaker, though we do have a five-year age gap and she grew up in more of an affluent environment.</p>
<p>My feeling of resistance against streaming and all of its internet-dependent and closed infrastructure has only grown. Given how digital music removes the enforced structure of physical storage (there are no <em>sides</em> in bits, of course) and yet there are still people who apply arbitrary limits on the web, I feel even less inclined to include streaming at all; it just feels dishonest, you know?</p>
<p>At this point I have Apple Music but have set it as no-download, stream online only; it is entirely an option only available whenever I happened to have access to a decent internet connection, and I think that works well since it is now in a distinct and appropriate context.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confident that, at least for now, we&rsquo;re ready to stay clear of what is bound to be an absolute mess of phrasing within the ever-muddled world of streaming and online music.</p>

<p>Clearly need to communicate this better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; <a href="https://www.manton.org/2022/01/17/every-once-in.html">Manton Reece</a></p>
<p>Some rambling thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The homepage has;
<ul>
<li>the Discover timeline prominently placed with posts from <em>15 months ago</em>;</li>
<li>a link to Brent Simmons from <em>four years ago</em>;</li>
<li>the Micro.blog team featured at the bottom with no links to anything.</li>
<li>Nothing at all about recent updates, like some sort of news alert message or&hellip; anything really.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maybe redirect my old Updates blog to News, or wherever you will show updates? Or just replace that blog with a new update-based blog? The last posts on there might leave a bad impression with regard to activity.</li>
<li>Activity on the News blog is good at times, but at times sporadic and still seems to be basically another of your blogs, Manton. I think people often expect &ldquo;a company voice&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s familiar and an indicator that this isn&rsquo;t just an indie side-project.
<ul>
<li>I thought there was some promise in the official news releases for the big 2.0 updates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even with News considered, there are also other blogs and the Help forums and different things at different times. It&rsquo;s all quite disparate, which is great for the indie ethos but not good for clear and consistent and reliable communication.</li>
<li>If there was one main blog for the team with each post authored &ndash; using the Teams feature obviously &ndash; that could help.</li>
<li>Although there is still the issue of <em>what</em> is being said. Is it enough? Can you know without looking at all of the posts together; the dev posts, the community posts, the big-picture posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; And this is mostly stuff that is insular to Micro.blog, the timelines, and whatnot. Beyond that there is the Twitter account, which is ok but again not what I think most people expect.</p>
<p>I know decentralisation and going slow are both important to Micro.blog but there&rsquo;s a point at which you have to compromise and go where people are used to going; to offer a hand rather than stay in your spot and expect people to be as motivated as the heart of your community.</p>
<p>I think about when <a href="http://blog.bellebcooper.com/leaving-microblog.html">a few years ago</a> Belle Cooper said &ldquo;It feels to me like we&rsquo;re all at a party at Manton&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; and how I didn&rsquo;t consider that to be too much of a problem at the time, given that it was still the early stages in the development of Micro.blog. Now, however, I think it&rsquo;s correct to expect Micro.blog to have a clear representation of how the product is not just &ldquo;for Manton, by Manton&rdquo; but so much more.</p>

<p>Google search isn‚Äôt as good as it used to be‚ÄîI suspect foul play through SEO</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; <a href="https://renevanbelzen.micro.blog/2022/01/09/i-can-easily.html">Rene van Belzen</a></p>
<p>These days we&rsquo;re often looking for a search engine that provides high quality results for specific questions, for free.</p>
<p>The problem here is that Google has sold everybody the complete lie that this is possible. Their results, their service, their websites, are all worse because products built on the back of money-free business models inevitably trend to that point.</p>
<p>Here are the different prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>money</li>
<li>work</li>
<li>attention</li>
</ul>
<p>The more you leverage the third one &ndash; the one that the mainstream web is now built upon &ndash; the worse your product becomes over time.</p>
<p>Of course, Rene has put some work in &ndash; two hours no less! &ndash; and he still has to deal with an inferior product. It&rsquo;s as if a bad standard has spread throughout all of Google Search. When the foundation of a platform is built with rotten ingredients, the rest is doomed to crumble into useless crap.</p>
<p>We have to change the way we think about things. It&rsquo;s one of the lessons I learned thanks to Micro.blog; the perception we had of the web as a result of the monopolistic behemoths, is false. Much of it is false, with very little effort put towards sustainability or any of the necessary energy required to build a healthy environment.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways it the web works better for you if you take on an older mindset; say, 5 to 10 years back, and spend less energy relying on whatever marketing spin comes from your behemoth service provider. I do this for every piece of tech I own and it serves me well.</p>
<p>Oh, as for Rene and his question, unfortunately I don&rsquo;t have the answer. I only know that it isn&rsquo;t so simple, or at least not as simple as a mega-corp&rsquo;s marketing department would have you believe.</p>

			 <p>I look forward to the day that Micro.blog plug-ins and themes are less of a black box of mystery. Good, easy-to-access documentation would further enable the <em>ownership</em> aspect of the Micro.blog philosophy. More people could make their own little world on their blog, like before.</p>

		<a href="https://swoods.net/2021/11/15/til-retiring-features.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-11-15 21:50:24 &#43;0100">Nov 15, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After <a href="https://swoods.net/2021/11/08/til-design-insight.html">last week&rsquo;s bundle of new additions</a>, I realised over the following days that there was another part to those changes; the <em>other shoe</em> as it were. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the release notes to see the complimentary updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://til.micro.blog/history">History page</a> is retired.</li>
<li><a href="https://til.micro.blog/categories/updates">Update</a> and <a href="https://til.micro.blog/categories/follow-up">Follow Up</a> are retired.</li>
<li><a href="https://buttondown.email/post-haste">Post Haste</a> is retired.</li>
<li>By The Community links page is now <a href="https://til.micro.blog/links/community/">Community</a>.</li>
<li>Micro.blog Core links page is now <a href="https://til.micro.blog/links/core/">Core</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://til.micro.blog/about">About page</a> and the links menu at the bottom of the site have been updated.</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; not quite so many üÜï badges, huh.</p>
<p>However the intent, and I hope effect, remain the same. I am making TIL the best possible companion to pair with the official support for Micro.blog and think that role is best fulfilled by providing much more direct, tangible resources. And that no longer includes custom tracking of Micro.blog updates from a third-party perspective.</p>
<p>Between the continued growth of Micro.blog and the team&rsquo;s official records of updates, you can keep abreast of such news in a <a href="https://help.micro.blog/">few</a> <a href="https://news.micro.blog/">different</a> <a href="https://www.manton.org/">places</a>. Plus, Manton has <a href="https://micro.blog/manton/12121887">recently hinted</a> at providing yet another source of this information.</p>
<p>When it comes to Post Haste, <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/10/11/little-screenshot-of.html">another hint</a> from Manton says more than I really need to. Whilst I am going to publish the last few issues of the special bumper edition The Macro Report, the weekly catch-up log ICYMI will become mostly, if not entirely redundant and so my time is better spent elsewhere.</p>
<p>Overall it&rsquo;s fair to say that the recent significant events of my personal life &ndash; moving home to a completely different part of the country &ndash; have inspired my focus in ways that I expected to a certain degree, yet not quite as much as they actually have. I&rsquo;m excited to see TIL change in these ways because it should be the best companion <em>within context of whatever Micro.blog needs</em> and that&rsquo;s exactly where my efforts are now focused.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>‚è§ Simon</p>

			 <p>With the release of the newest set of updates to <a href="https://micro.blog/TIL">@TIL</a>, I am happy to say that the unofficial companion to Micro.blog has entered the next phase of its development.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the release notes for those TL:DR fans out there:</p>
<h3 id="til-19">TIL 1.9:</h3>
<ul>
<li>üÜï Banner at <a href="https://til.micro.blog/">the top of the site</a>.
<ul>
<li>(thanks to <a href="https://custom.micro.blog/2019/07/05/add-a-header.html">Miraz</a> via <a href="https://micro.blog/custom">@custom</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>üÜï Button for The Insight Program also at the top.</li>
<li>üÜï Listed Link buttons at the bottom.
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://%F0%9F%95%B8%F0%9F%92%8D.ws">IndieWeb Webring</a> and <a href="https://indieseek.xyz">Indieseek directory</a> are both fantastic examples of the independent web doing what it does best.</li>
<li>Thanks to both <a href="https://micro.blog/schmarty">@schmarty</a> and <a href="https://micro.blog/bradenslen">@bradenslen</a> for their work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>üÜï Emoji prefixes for posts.</li>
<li>Wider pages, larger text, design fixes.</li>
<li><em>Unofficial</em> added to the tagline.</li>
<li>Large parts of <a href="https://til.micro.blog/about">the About page</a> rewritten.</li>
<li>üÜï Banners + avatars, and profile edits; <a href="https://micro.blog/TIL">Micro.blog</a> + <a href="https://twitter.com/til_micro_blog">Twitter</a>.</li>
<li>üÜï Membership <a href="https://til.memberful.com/join">launched on Memberful</a>.</li>
<li>Buy Me A Coffee page <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/simonwoods/moving-memberful">closed</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unofficial">Unofficial</h2>
<p>One of the updates is for the edits made to include the word <em>unofficial</em> in the TIL tagline. This better reflects the reality of the endeavour; yes I do get help from the team but this is not an official part of Micro.blog at all. It&rsquo;s all just me, making it happen, and as such it&rsquo;s better to make this as obvious as possible.</p>
<p>One of the reasons this is important is cost. As time passes and TIL grows, and as my standards improve &ndash; albeit unsteadily for the past 18 months &ndash; I have reached an inflection point. The project can not remain stable or grow further without money, and whilst I wish I could tell you my recent big home move resulted in an immediate and entirely surprising <em>increase</em> in our income&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be unsurprised that is very much not the case.</p>
<p>As such I have closed the Buy Me A Coffee page and now invite you to take a look at the first membership offering for Today I Learned: <a href="https://til.memberful.com/join">The Insight Program</a>. Right now it is entirely donation-based, with no rewards on offer. As I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine, this is not the plan for the long term; in fact, the very reason I have moved to Memberful is due to the numerous ways in which their platform is so much better made for offering a variety of memberships. This is a start&hellip; I am looking forward to doing more.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice on the Memberful site that I have detailed the costs of TIL, including my fundraising goal for this version of the membership. I am doing everything I can to work around costs; using free trials, renting, finding free versions of software, carefully managing my computer&hellip; just as much as I can think of. I hope my intention here is as transparent as possible; every single penny that is put towards a plan in The Insight Program will be put directly into running Today I Learned.</p>
<p>Here is a quick example of the current situation regarding costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setapp has expired. Having finished the 7-day trial of the rental service, I had quickly made use of a few apps for TIL.
<ul>
<li>Although, to be honest, the ongoing cost of the subscription is likely not the best choice even if in the short term it could be helpful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NounPro Unlimited will expire in 3 weeks. The premium subscription for The Noun Project has already been put to use in a number of the design updates you can now see on the site and external profiles.</li>
<li>Sketch trial will expire in 3 weeks. Similar to Noun, only in this instance practically <em>all</em> of the new graphics in use for TIL were made in Sketch.
<ul>
<li>Much like with Setapp, I am unsure if this subscription makes sense in the long run. Though I have a back-up plan, which you can see listed on the Memberful site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; and so I will continued to do my best in this way. Please let me know if you&rsquo;re aware of any comparable free alternatives (MBP High Sierra 13.6), including that which is listed on the Memberful site.</p>
<p>Speaking of costs being covered and the overwhelming generosity of the community, I would like to give a wholehearted thank you to the multiple donors to the Buy Me A Coffee page. You&rsquo;re all just fantastic and have left me flabbergasted, having literally helped my family move and thus massively improve our standard of living. On top of that, just 3 days ago Matt Cassem (<a href="https://micro.blog/sarcassem">@sarcassem</a>) donated enough to cover email hosting for the next 12 months <em>with</em> money to spare that will be put to use in another part of TIL.</p>
<p>Seriously&hellip; overwhelming ‚ò∫Ô∏è</p>
<p>Yes, so, you can help out with either a single donation or a monthly payment. The links to these can be found <a href="https://til.micro.blog/about">on the newly updated About page</a> as well as <a href="https://til.memberful.com/join">the Memberful site itself</a>.</p>
<h2 id="realign">Realign</h2>
<p>Last week I changed the posting schedule for the site, introducing later posts as a result of an unexpected shift in my personal schedule. This may become a permanent change but I can&rsquo;t say for sure. Either way I&rsquo;ll continue to work to make publishing as reliable and consistent as possible.</p>
<p>Post Haste is currently on hold. Between uncertainty regarding email hosting costs and a switch to Fastmail that has been a little complicated regarding Buttondown hosting, there was suddenly something of a hurdle between writing the issues of the newsletter and publishing them. Thanks to the aforementioned good news regarding email hosting and <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/10/11/little-screenshot-of.html">the teaser screenshot posted by Manton last month</a>, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be much longer before ICYMI is back.</p>
<p>Major design updates are now finished for at least the next few months. Version 1.9 means what it implies; the next change for the site, and likely the various extensions that make up TIL, will be 2.0 and all that entails. I have been working on ideas for this and look forward to getting my hands dirty with Hugo in particular. In the meantime I&rsquo;ll make fixes and minor tweaks for smaller updates but as has once been said before: no new features.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was both a lot of fun and quite stressful to put together these changes. In the end it has been the most satisfying update to make, and I hope you&rsquo;ll join me in making this feel like just the beginning.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to building 2.0 but mostly, next, I can already feel the excitement for some new features that will hopefully be out very soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll be back with regular activity throughout the week and will see you at the next big announcement.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>‚è§ Simon</p>

			 <p>Earlier today I <a href="https://simonmumbles.micro.blog/2021/09/09/i-hate-to.html">put out a short post to ask for help</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my wife and I have discovered that we will be short of money to cover all of our bills this month, and it is making what is an otherwise life-changing event into an all-too familiar ball of stress, anxiety, and frankly, shame.</p>
<p>With that in mind I&rsquo;m going to step outside of my usual tight-lipped approach and provide a preview of the direct benefit to donating towards my efforts with Today I Learned.</p>
<p>Here are the things <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/simonwoods">your donation</a> can help me make:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guides:</strong> The existing Guides will be updated, and more importantly a whole new batch will be published over a short period of time. This will relaunch Guides as a regular post type, including special editions in which related Guides are published over the space of a week.</li>
<li>Return to <strong>regular posting</strong>. Everything from before the break &ndash; Tips, Updates, Introducing, Lookup, the recently launched Linked posts, and ICYMI: the weekly catch-up edition of the newsletter &ndash; plus the return of The Macro Report.</li>
<li>The rest of the <strong>special edition of The Macro Report</strong>.</li>
<li>Reactivation of the Twitter account, with which I&rsquo;ll make it easier for people outside of Micro.blog to see just how awesome our community is.</li>
<li>Further <strong>design improvements</strong> to the site and Post Haste (the newsletter).</li>
<li>Brand new regular post types, starting with a <strong>micro-guide that is entirely image-based</strong>.</li>
<li>A new edition of <strong>Post Haste</strong>, built around staying updated with urgent Micro.blog events.</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; and more. My plans reach well into the future, with everything built on a steady and sustainable timeline. On <a href="https://til.micro.blog/support/">the Support page</a> I state that I won&rsquo;t make promises, so this feels even more uncomfortable to write.</p>
<p>However, I hope that highlights just how urgent my current needs have become. You wouldn&rsquo;t just be helping my family, you would also be securing the path to Today I Learned 2.0. üôè</p>

			 <p>Regarding <a href="https://til.micro.blog">Today I Learned</a>:</p>
<p>The project is currently on hiatus (covered in <a href="https://til.micro.blog/2021/07/08/today-i-learned.html">the latest update</a>). Whilst part of the reason for this is good (the aforementioned move), there is also a negative motivation; my work is currently unsustainable.</p>
<p>What I mean is that I lack the hardware and software to both maintain and grow Today I learned, and have no way to gain those resources. These include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A computer. The iPad isn‚Äôt good enough as the only machine.</li>
<li>Hosted services. Email, hosted accounts, sharing, storage, publishing.</li>
<li>Editing software. Graphics, code, video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The greater access to these tools, the sooner I can push my ideas into full production across the project.</p>
<p>Whilst this issue might be resolved in the near future (as a result of the move), it is also possible that the change to my family‚Äôs life will be so significant that there will be no room at all. Even if I were to be in a much better position to work on Today I Learned, it offers no immediate and obvious route for either earning money directly or in the near future; any potential path for advancing my career ambitions seems to point to a long-term result. There is a great deal of uncertainty here.</p>
<p>I could gain the necessary resources but still choose to put an end to Today I Learned. In this instance I would instead do everything needed to attain paid work of a similar kind (independent, remote, maybe on the web) and use a combination of the existing published work of Today I Learned and the plans that are currently WIP as proof of my abilities in pursuit of said work. On top of that I would also continue to work on other, less ambitious ideas to beef up my body of work.</p>
<p>Given the limited space for me to do this kind of work, to do any sort of work, the time has come for me to make a decision. I am ready to take the next step with regard to ambitions beyond my work as a carer and home-maker. Now the question remains:</p>
<p>Continue with Today I Learned or commit to work in which resources are guaranteed?</p>

			 <p>A quick update to say that I‚Äôm putting Today I Learned on hiatus as of this post. The aforementioned <a href="http://swoods.net/2021/06/29/summer-hiatus.html">unfinished work</a> will either be published when I return with the project, or will end up in the ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù pile.</p>

			 <p>I didn‚Äôt think I would be writing this kind of message again but life is funny that way.</p>
<p>tl;dr ‚Äî Good news! My wife and I are moving for good reasons. I‚Äôm taking a break from the web for a few months, and putting Today I Learned back on hiatus until October at the earliest. This includes deciding whether Today I Learned will return at all.</p>
<p>Last week Claire and I took a trip to another part of the country, the purpose of which was for her to attend a job interview. The wonderful news is that she was offered the job! We took the contract home with us a day after we had arrived and then over the weekend continued to talk about this possibility; the prospect of moving again, only this time it would be different.</p>
<p>This time it would be into a place, in all sense of the word, that has much greater potential for us to do the things we‚Äôve been wanting to do for a long time. An opportunity not to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Yesterday I took a brisk walk to the nearby post box and sent the signed contract on its way. So now, as seems to be the trendy thing to do on Micro.blog, we are moving. We‚Äôve done this a few times before but never with such a <em>household‚Äôs</em> worth of possessions nor to such a great opportunity. It‚Äôs fair to say that the next couple of months are going to be full of all the nervous energy you can think of, with all kinds of priorities shifted around.</p>
<p>What that means is a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It‚Äôs highly likely that I won‚Äôt be around on the web in general.</li>
<li>Today I Learned is yet again undergoing a period of inactivity; a hiatus, for at least 3 months.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first point is not so bad, since it‚Äôs good to take a break from the internet on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The second, however, is complicated‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I have been so happy to gradually bring Today I Learned back to life, and up until the past couple of weeks things were going particularly well. Now I have been given an opportunity to think about the project in the long-run, to consider my opportunities and what may come.</p>
<p>Right now there is no more room for Today I Learned. I am limited by my resources, or lack thereof, <em>and</em> have reached a point where I am ready to work on more than just a hobby project whilst lacking the opportunity to make Today I Learned more than it is.</p>
<p>Over the next week or so I‚Äôll publish the few posts and edits that are already in the works. After that I‚Äôll post an update when the hiatus begins, and that‚Äôll be all for the next few months.</p>
<p>So I‚Äôll be back in October either way. See you then!</p>

			 <p>Re: <a href="http://swoods.net/2021/05/14/if-apple-doesnt.html">my realisation that the magic keyboard can not make up for iPad OS limitations</a></p>
<p>At least with my old Windows machine I could brute-force certain things ‚Äî you know, like you can when you have an actual functioning browser ‚Äî but on the iPad that‚Äôs either not possible or full of so many little catches that it becomes a fool‚Äôs errand.</p>
<p>For all of the things I like about this machine, and that list is long in comparison, the fact remains that my old and busted Windows computer was overall a much better computer.</p>
<p>To that end, I agree <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/04/26/inch-ipad-pro.html">with Manton‚Äôs incredulity regarding price disparity</a> and now wish that I had chosen a Mac of some kind instead of this iPad.</p>

			 <p>If Apple doesn‚Äôt fix certain things about iPad OS this summer I‚Äôm going to sell this magic keyboard. If I had a Mac right now this would still be the case; this machine is a great tablet, however not nearly good enough for anybody remotely interested in the web even as a hobby.</p>

			 <p>Over on the Micro.blog Help forums, <a href="https://micro.blog/numericcitizen">@numericcitizen</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is MB a side-line for Manton ? Is there other people involved in maintaining this platform? I wasn‚Äôt expecting the pandemic to be an issue for an internet-only business like MB. I could be wrong, for sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manton does large amounts of the work for the tech side of things (servers, new code, etc). That‚Äôs on top of support, marketing, long-term planning, being the most visible part of the platform, <em>and</em> you know, having a life.</li>
<li>The pandemic literally affected every part of our lives. A virus doesn‚Äôt care what type of business you have.</li>
<li>Texas, where Manton lives, was hit badly by a ridiculous weather event, only further compacting the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, where I definitely think you are wrong is the scope of Micro.blog and how it differs from other such platforms. Guess what? We <strong>don‚Äôt</strong> want the team to work themselves to the bone in a terrible environment and thus inevitably burn-out.</p>
<p>Have you listened to Manton on the Micro Monday podcast? Between every episode on which he has featured, including the latest, and the way he writes about Micro.blog it shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult to understand how this works. In fact in that most recent episode (the 100th, with Patrick Rhone) there was a discussion about Micro.blog taking on new people. Not only that but Manton‚Äôs own development podcast, Timetable, also covers some of these issues.</p>
<p>Maybe some of these things aren‚Äôt obvious enough and it would be good to make it explicit in some way. However, I could be completely wrong about all of it. ü§∑</p>
<p>(Aside: @-mentioning Manton in your reply was an odd choice, as if you‚Äôre trying to call him out. I hope that wasn‚Äôt your intent.)</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve returned to thinking about the internet and what it is, in light of working on what it <em>could be</em>. Most recently <a href="http://swoods.net/2020/10/10/very-quickly-realised.html">I posted about the rat-like presence of Google</a>.</p>
<p>Of course this is not disimilar to worrying about S3, Azure, and even Google&rsquo;s own server hosting. Then take a look at technologies such as React, massive software development-based sites like GitHub, and even the ties between the open web and mega-companies like Samsung with regard to open source&hellip;</p>
<p>The internet, much like the real world, shows many paths to living life connected to all sorts of awful people with very few options for small, self-starting groups of people to truly establish themselves free from the hideous behemoths our societies have built over the past many decades.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not discouraged by this. I simply believe you have to gain an understanding of the mountainous obstacles that stand before you, should you wish to overcome them at all.</p>

			 <p>This is a reply to <a href="https://micro.blog/vivianlee">@vivianlee</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You‚Äôll have to excuse my ignorance here, but you could elaborate on the negative effects of hashtags? I‚Äôm new to the IndieWeb philosophy, and having just come from the likes of Twitter and Instagram, the lack of hashtags here has made it difficult for discovery. I‚Äôm wondering what the workaround is, and why hashtags would be a negative thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://micro.blog/vivianlee/10071751">original comment</a>)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as well-informed on all of the technical aspects or any work that has been done to support this position &ndash; case studies, etc &ndash; but I do have a general view based on my experiences in the hashtag-heavy platforms vs. Micro.blog and my old days on message boards and the like.</p>
<p>A lot of the behaviour around hashtags for those with ill will is about tracking and campaigning at speed; using algorithms for trending to target and pile-on people and groups. It can also become easy to ruin a topic that has until that point been carefully curated by the people involved, whether through crude spambots or planned, targeted campaigns.</p>
<p>The flip-side of that is of course moderation, whether from the people running the platform or via account-based tools made available to each person. Whilst I&rsquo;m not aware of what <em>exactly</em> could be done with such resources, I know for sure that either way it is likely to be a lot of work for such a small team.</p>
<p>There is also the question of priorities within the context of culture; are hashtags, with all of the associated work, what Micro.blog needs right now? From my experience this is the kind of mechanism that can <em>quickly</em> lead to significant unintended consequences and so the positive value &ndash; which is basically just discovery &ndash; needs to be carefully weighed against the costs.</p>
<p>As for the alternatives, on Micro.blog it&rsquo;s a mix of direct-ish approaches;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.micro.blog/2018/tagmoji/">tagmoji</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://help.micro.blog/2019/following/">discover search</a>;</li>
<li>and <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2020/categories/">categories for hosted blogs</a>;</li>
</ul>
<p>and the in-direct approach that has become part of the culture of Micro.blog;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.micro.blog/2019/discover-timeline/">the Discover timeline</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://help.micro.blog/2019/micro-monday/">Micro Monday</a>;</li>
<li>and <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/07/12/following-users-ui.html">the <em>not-following</em> list on profiles</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: there is also a <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2019/finding-people/">Micro.blog help page covering this subject</a>)</p>
<p>These alternatives also work well with philosophies of the open web, which preclude the silos; specifcally, the idea of the <a href="https://inessential.com/2018/02/01/why_micro_blog_is_not_another_app_net">open web as the great social network</a>, where we use feeds, email, newsletters, and other such technology and platforms that are largely non-proprietary. This means greater agency, independence, control, and less manipulation for all involved; it becomes a lot less like everybody dumping their posts into a bucket of faceless, nameless <em>content</em> whilst parasitical entities take advantage of our ignorance and lack of ownership.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think hashtags are intrinisic to the destructive nature of the web, rather I am unaware of any way for a small team to harness their power without sacrificing the good of Micro.blog; the intention, the curation, the personal contact, the idea that we are all people sharing space with some degree of control, and choosing to take our actions no matter what they might be.</p>

			 <p>I have been without a PC for a number or days now, having actively removed PC activity from my daily routines weeks ago. Essentially, my phone and my watch are my only computers.</p>
<p>As a result, I have learned that I never had a tolerance for lengthy reading on a small screen in the first place let alone having not developed such a thing ever since owning my first smartphone.</p>
<p>This is the first time in over a decade that I have not used a PC on a daily basis, and whilst I yearn for a tool with which to work on <a href="https://micro.blog/til">@til</a> the fact remains that this process has cleared my mind of an unhealthy reliance on the web as my only source for information and, well, just about everything else.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to the continued rediscovering of the good habits from my pre-online life <em>and</em> developing a much better balance of my time and energy in the future, should I ever own a PC again.</p>
<p>(Note: either way, iOS remains an unreliable tool for lengthy writing and I doubt that will ever change for me, for a whole host of reasons)</p>

			 <p>Today I Learned is <a href="https://til.micro.blog/2020/05/28/maintenance-mode.html">now in maintenance mode</a>.</p>
<p>I am currently sitting at our desk in what we once called the office. Now it‚Äôs the utility room. This change, like so many others over the past two and a half months, has been monumental and yet so small.</p>
<p>Lots of things are happening, some of which I may or may not talk about but altogether can be summarised thus: I‚Äôm finally taking my work seriously, giving it the space and resources needed to get the job done at a basic standard let alone anything approaching <em>good</em>. All in all, this is a good thing, and made all the easier due to lots and lots of changes since even before the COVID-19 pandemic became the wrecking ball of change with which we are all currently attempting to grapple.</p>
<p>As for Today I Learned, well, the unfortunate truth is that I do not have the resources to spare for its continued operation and so the recent hiatus has now become a full maintenance mode which, as the previously linked announcement states, means there will be no publishing of any kind for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>I find it difficult to express my gratitude for all of the support from the Micro.blog community for Today I Learned. So I‚Äôll just say this: if you‚Äôre feeling pessimistic about the web and the world in general, please take part in the Micro.blog community for at least a few months and you‚Äôll find yourself living in an example of how the world can be a better place. Without this community I wouldn‚Äôt be in such a positive place as to handle monumental change and actually thrive, it‚Äôs as simple as that.</p>
<p>Over the next few months I‚Äôll probably continue to be elusive as far as posting is concerned. At the moment I‚Äôm mostly reading feeds, reading in general, watching the various forms of video available via the web, and playing lots of video games. In many ways I‚Äôm in a maintenance mode of my own; I have increased the volume of input from the world, this amazing world we‚Äôve made via the web, whilst simultaneously decreasing my output. This process has been&hellip; necessary. Vital even.</p>
<p>So I‚Äôm off to continue focusing on the most important parts of my life, and enjoying a summer of much needed self reflection.</p>
<p>I hope everybody who reads this is well and doing what is needed to live in this our strange pandemic-influenced time.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll see you in the replies. üëã</p>

			 <p><a href="https://blog.swoods.net/2020/02/26/with-firefox-alone.html">The literal cost of using the modern web slapped me in the face just now</a>. It got me thinking&hellip;</p>
<p>This is one of those things that inspires me to think about what life would be like if I gave up being as involved with the web as I currently am.</p>
<p>I could save the desktop for mostly offline work, with limited access to the web saved purely for uploading/sharing stuff, and then rely mostly on mobile computing. This could fit in with spending more time outside, taking my new main computer with me, and generally avoid the muck of tracking-based platforms of services.</p>
<p>IDK&hellip; maybe becoming &ldquo;anti-connected&rdquo; to some degree. Essentially reverse my general trend of the past decade and switch much more of my focus to the people near me. I wouldn&rsquo;t be anywhere near as involved with the web because I simply wouldn&rsquo;t have the time or other resources, as part of an intentional decision to free myself of the misery that is the modern web.</p>
<p>However! I could still work on TIL. I mean, the beauty of Micro.blog is that I don&rsquo;t have to sell my soul to really understand it, test things out, etc.</p>
<p>A lot of these thoughts have become possible thanks to moving to Firefox. Between the Containers feature and lack of focus on the Google silo, it really has helped me to think about what I am doing on the web through a lens of pragmatism and with a greater degree of transparency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for me to think about this in a real way, to make changes that are practical. I actually think it will help a lot with TIL, since it lines up nicely with the philosophies upon which Micro.blog was built. In particular it&rsquo;s the idea of a &ldquo;good web&rdquo;, in which we have the ability to control our online presence and not have to accept a life lived as little more than value-based data, a faceless thing there to be used for the efforts of other people to increase their ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p>This is a lot of meta-style talk, which I didn&rsquo;t want to spend so much time on in public posts. However, it is a significant process for me on a number of levels and I would like to have a public record of my thinking as I go through the process of making the aforementioned changes over the next few months.</p>

<p>Having shared <a href="https://euansemple.blog/2020/02/21/shit-tinted-glasses/">Euan Semple&rsquo;s thought-provoking post</a>, Adam got a fairly quick reply <a href="https://micro.blog/petebrown/8443490">from Pete Brown</a> which only further provoked me to once again consider a general viewpoint I have been wrestling with for the past few years.</p>
<p>An important point of context within these issues that is often neglected: these companies, this version of the web, a lot of it is US-centric. They are literally constructs made from the culture of the US, and whilst of course they are also built with a diversity of viewpoints I think it is vital to remember that there <em>is</em> a difference in how these things are built even compared to that which is most similar, for example Canada.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe I live in too much of a bubble of my circumstances in life but the fact remains that I have yet to meet people who are so desparately in need of the connected web on our own little island, as compared to seemingly large numbers of Americans for whom the internet has been something of a lifeboat. Not to say it <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> significant here, of course it is, but rather that there is difference in the difference even between our two relatively similar nations&hellip; that the environment is different, there are different motivations for the various part of our societies, and that&rsquo;s before we even get to Europe and further afield.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just never quite felt that if I were to sacrifice the internet my life would be inescapably ruined; at least with regard to the social, overly worked part of the internet where the silos and the like exist. As such I have never quite felt that this is necessarily a socio-economic aspect of our lives that requires constant and immediate care. In many ways, it truly is what it is and little else.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s ok to slow down.</p>
<p>When we slow down, it becomes <em>much</em> easier to avoid mistakes and hurt people. We can take a breath, take more than a single look at something, and consider different points of view.</p>
<p>So. Seriously.</p>

			 <p>The firmer I become in my convictions that the independent web is the neccessary alternative to social media, the more likely I am to question that feeling.</p>
<p>Have the silos simply figured it out and we, as a species, inevitably trend to this system?</p>
<p>If so, then the independent alternative is surely a waste of time.</p>
<p>Life should be about <em>people</em> and if all of the people on the web are in the silos, then that is where we should be.</p>
<p>Sure, a bunch of people might reply to this &ndash; I have been very lucky to find a great community on Micro.blog, for example &ndash; and that might include lengthy replies with fiery disagreements to my conclusions.</p>
<p>But ask yourself: who will read that?</p>
<ul>
<li>The people who are so busy living their lives that they don&rsquo;t have time to read blogs? I doubt it.</li>
<li>The people who read blogs and oppose social media (except that they have social media accounts for totally legitimate serious reasons you couldn&rsquo;t possibly pick apart we promise)? Congratulations, you are preaching to the choir.</li>
<li>The people who have similar values and will make breakthroughs in convincing the mainstream to reject social media? That&rsquo;s possible! After all, people like Manton Reece and Jean MacDonald enjoy reading blogs.</li>
<li>The people who wield influence in our broader socio-economic systems, which have provided the support structures for silos to both exist and monopolise the web? Even if they read it, the chances they would change anything to balance out the silos are likely small.</li>
</ul>
<p>So why are we bothering?</p>
<p>Why do we build against the silos?</p>
<p>What makes the independent web &ndash; in its current environment that is hostile to the average user of silos &ndash; worth adopting, warts and all?</p>

			 <p>(I&rsquo;m getting this bullshit out of my system.)</p>
<p>Potential Twitter set-up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiny follow list, mostly read in a RSS reader via <a href="https://feedbin.com/blog/2018/01/11/feedbin-is-the-best-way-to-read-twitter/">Feedbin&rsquo;s brilliant integration</a>.</li>
<li>Everything else followed via lists, with the Pinned Lists feature in the first-party app.</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as settings go, that depends on how the above works out. If I end up following a larger group of people than intended (for example, if the pinned lists and RSS integration don&rsquo;t work well, as I&rsquo;m sure Twitter would prefer) there will be no retweets in my timeline, I&rsquo;ll constantly keep the chronological option switched on, and will maintain a significant list of filters.</p>
<p>I love third-party apps but am convinced they&rsquo;re not long for this world. Honestly, even with this specific set-up the whole point is to make it easier to stay away from the empty-headed, addictive use of a platform that is designed specifically to inspire that behaviour. As such, I&rsquo;ll have time limits in place, which is a big part of my life anyway what with having more than one job and actual responsibilities with actual consequences if they aren&rsquo;t fulfilled.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you&rsquo;re reading this and follow me over there please don&rsquo;t be offended if I don&rsquo;t [pound-sign]FollowBack. That&rsquo;s just now I use these things and that is unlikely to ever change.</p>
<p>OK. Let&rsquo;s see if that has flushed this nonsense from my mind, at least in its current state of heistant wreckage.</p>

<p>All that&rsquo;s left at this point is to weigh the effort of maintaining a non-terrible experience against losing the good people who are exclusive to that platform. Even with RSS, awesome smaller networks like that of Micro.blog, and newsletters the fact remains that a number of people are fun to follow blogging-wise and they do so exclusively on Twitter.</p>
<p>This is an issue I would like to resolve, at least for the foreseeable future. To some extent it is a waste of my time, a distraction, and not the good kind. This is exactly what I am determined to avoid as much as possible.</p>
<p>Anyway. Blogging about blogging. I&rsquo;m super fucking original that way.</p>

			 <p>Making things for the web as if the hyper-surveillance era never began is important. It&rsquo;s one of few ways we can contribute to a web without surveillance, wherein the things you put on the web are there to exist for every reason <em>other than</em> partaking in our broken system.</p>

<p>Manton had <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/11/17/whenever-a-new.html">more to say about this today</a> and I agree with him. Whether those of us who are driven in any way by ideological motives like it or not, the fact remains that copy-pasting functionality from the existing behemoths is a complete waste of time.</p>
<p>Why would anyone bother with your new thing if it just does what the existing thing does, only with fewer people? That is not an effective way to motivate people and we&rsquo;re never going to change anything if we fail to understand how people are motivated to make changes in their lives.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/walter/5242648">A reply to the ongoing discussion about replies</a></p>
<p>Going back to at least earlier this year it seemed like the limit on replies was going to be shortened, or at least that was the plan, and if that does happen at any point then all of a sudden the whole &ldquo;let&rsquo;s start a conversation&rdquo; dynamic is much different; perhaps people would be more inclined to take such conversations elsewhere (messaging services, email, physical space, etc) and so the value of the short-reply conversation (micro-convo if you will) stands alone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a chance with only short replies allowed that replies themselves will take on more of their own identity, and a core part of that will be the shorter replies themselves. Then they would be not just something that is so easily considered clutter. However, I do agree with Smokey that these issues could be better solved via timeline filtering, of which there is already a foundation (filtering out mentions to people you do not follow) <em>and</em> as compared to introducing a &ldquo;like&rdquo; system is much less likely to fundamentally alter the entire platform.</p>
<p>I also like <a href="https://micro.blog/johnjohnston/5256922">John&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;disappearing likes.&rdquo;</a> It reminds me of how Snapchat first became popular due to disappearing posts, except this could serve as less destructive version of &ldquo;likes&rdquo; in general.</p>
<p>Overall when it comes to cluttered timelines I&rsquo;m not at all convinced that introducing a reply-wide change to the system is the best way to go, since it feels too much like shoving something on everybody because <em>some</em> people think of short replies as clutter. For those who do think this way, have you considered using RSS in conjunction with Micro.blog? I find it&rsquo;s easier to get at the exact posts you want this way, rather than looking to turn the conversation host (Micro.blog) into something fundamentally different.</p>
<p>Right now replies definitely need some updates and I think this is one of the issues that ought to be addressed. Personally, as somebody outside of the Apple ecosystem I feel there are bigger problems; even short replies are hard work when it comes to just using the web but I think updates to the replies feature across all systems would be a great upgrade for Micro.blog as a whole.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve just been reading twitter in my browser &ndash; it&rsquo;s a bad procrastination habit but now I at least try to read good, creative, often positive things as a way to make it a good habit &ndash; and I prefer scrolling via the keyboard. The cursor is in the address bar and it is very difficult to get it out of there, maybe even impossible&hellip; this is a terrible design and surely only made to <em>encourage</em> people into just getting the app and, more importantly, only really using it on your phone/iPad.</p>
<p>It is utterly frustrating to see &ldquo;everybody&rdquo; (read: lots of mostly active people) using these silos, these services, and just going along with it like cattle. It is a wave of lazy living, lazy thinking, and fear-lead decision making that has brought us to a point wherein <em>good</em> stories on the web are now largely trapped within ecosystems that are increasingly designed to be prisons and little more.</p>
<p>The question is: just give up and go with the crowd, or continue to hold what you think is the better idea &ndash; in this instance: the open web, open standards, websites made to good standards, accessible postings, and the slow and steady growth of the technologies therein &ndash; in the hope that eventually our stories and ideas will become less trapped?</p>

			 <p>(Note: I originally wrote this on Slack, <a href="https://microblogging.slack.com/archives/C3TMLHTL2/p1560377760084100">as part of a thread about Micro.blog as a name</a>.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know naming isn&rsquo;t easy but I think I find it hard because M.b gets used for the company, individual blogs, the app and the timeline respectively in the following sentence (although arguably the second &ldquo;Micro.blog&rdquo; should be &ldquo;microblog&rdquo;):</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I post to my Micro.blog hosted Micro.blog using Micro.blog it gets cross-posted to Micro.blog&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; Matthew Lindfield Seager (<a href="https://micro.blog/matt17r">@matt17r</a>), <a href="https://microblogging.slack.com/archives/C3TMLHTL2/p1560373981077700">in the Indie Microblogging Slack</a></p>
<p>I think part of the issue here, especially if you&rsquo;re going to compare to social media silos, is that they are not interested in differentiating these things&hellip; whether it&rsquo;s Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, YouTube, whatever&hellip; they are simply interested in people not ever thinking about the technical side of things.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Micro.blog fully embraces the technical side of things yet is also driven by a desire to make things as simple as possible.</p>
<p>As such, tbh, things aren&rsquo;t cleanly and easily tucked into a nice little marketable pocket of jargon. If people don&rsquo;t like the inevitable downsides of social media silos then they&rsquo;re going to have to at least become aware of things like &ldquo;blogs&rdquo;, &ldquo;posts&rdquo;, &ldquo;microblogs&rdquo;, and so on.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean people have to become experts or even especially comfortable with these concepts but they will need to acknowledge that there is no easy, one-size-fits-all answer for posting and sharing things on the web. Maybe over time the language will get easier but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be because the marketing improves; rather, it&rsquo;s time for people on the web to become better citizens.</p>

<p>No one is forcing these game developers to take these jobs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; <a href="https://micro.blog/frostedechoes">@frostedechoes</a>, <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2019/05/27/jason-morehead-writes.html">on the effects felt by developers when creating violent video games</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst I understand this isn&rsquo;t the core of Robert&rsquo;s point, I will note that I see this kind of qualifier quite a lot across different issues, and I think it&rsquo;s important for all of us to also make note of the fact that there is an agent influencing the decisions of, well, everybody. That agent is the socio-economic system, the culture we prop up with our many decisions, for which there is no current alternative. If we had a better alternative then things could be different; for example, introducing both universal healthcare and universal basic income would create <em>significant</em> foundations upon which we could all make better decisions.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, in many cases these developers are in the USA and these terrible jobs are still preferable to having no job, almost entirely due to the punitive treatment of unemployment in said country.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://opuszine.us/posts/how-violent-video-games-affect-their-developers">looking at what Jason has said</a>, he ends with the idea of questioning whether to support certain art or not. Again, an easy thing, Jason is taking the much easier route of looking at this small insignificant piece&hellip; those pieces do <strong>nothing</strong> when compared to the foundational issues here, even if they are much easier to talk about.</p>

<p>I think people neglect to write blog posts because the feedback loop is not as tangible as the onslaught of (sometimes mechanical) likes or faves that you can receive on a social network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; <a href="https://bitsplitting.org/2019/05/24/blog-a-little/">Daniel Jalkut, <em>Blog a Little</em></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame people believe what those at Facebook, Twitter, and such like would prefer them to believe; specifically, just because the audience seems to be all on those closed networks that it is therefore the best option to just post everything there and never have an independent, self-owned option as the core of whatever you are posting.</p>
<p>Instead, it&rsquo;ll be great even if people just change how they think about the whole system, to realise that the closed networks can be useful for specific types of broadcasting but that&rsquo;s about it. Even then, with regard to messaging not only do we have feed technology but also email and the unbelievable flexibility of open web software as a whole.</p>
<p>It has been encouraging to see the influential voices of the web become louder about these issues in the past few years. It might not be obvious at first but the truth is that we can only build a better world if we learn from our history, identify the good in what we have done, and then attempt to build on that. I truly believe that we can maintain the internet as a force for good, specifically with the web, so long as we hold close to the values of independence, generous spirit, and free thinking; all of which are possible with a web that itself is as open and independent as possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LongLiveTheOpenWeb?src=hash">#LongLiveTheOpenWeb</a> is another good piece in a movement well worth your time, doubtless there will be more to come and we will all be here, ready to blog a lot.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/numericcitizen/3438266">an interesting conversation here regarding Apple and support documentation</a>, specifically with regard to what is missing.</p>
<p>This is embarrassing. &ldquo;It Just Works&rdquo; should more than cover <em>documentation</em>. I don&rsquo;t know how many people I&rsquo;ve read and heard in revered tone about &ldquo;The Most Holy HIG&rdquo; and so on&hellip; seriously, they are a <strong>trillion dollar company</strong> and don&rsquo;t have the resources to make comprehensive guidance across ALL formats? That is utter bullshit and completely user hostile.</p>
<p>Oh, also, don&rsquo;t forget that &ldquo;you&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo; will make an appearance from time-to-time whenever the executives have been lowered to our level in response to something on which the company has fucked up.</p>
<p>I see a lot of &ldquo;they&rsquo;re premium&rdquo; whenever somebody brings up Apple being expensive. Irrespective of the realities of premium or not, Apple certainly <em>screams</em> premium with everything they do but the deep holes in their user documentation, whatever the format, is terrible and counter to even the slightest notion of a premium experience.</p>

<p>I was <a href="https://blog.swoods.net/2019/03/22/goodbye-internet.html">getting ahead of myself</a>. <em>Today I Learned</em> is not going to stop &ndash; to be fair, <a href="https://micro.blog/handy/2870044">that seemed unlikely anyway</a> &ndash; but I did need to take a break, to take a few steps back and think about why it was that I felt the way I did; I was tired and in pain, generally feeling down, and none of it had anything to do with a need for TIL to stop.</p>
<p>Rather, I need to do two things;</p>
<ul>
<li>be patient with myself;</li>
<li>be kinder to myself.</li>
</ul>
<p>I may or may not elaborate further on this in some form or another but I think that&rsquo;s enough for now. The core of this post is to say that TIL is very much back on track, <a href="https://til.micro.blog/2019/04/23/updates-lots-happening.html">with updates and all</a>, and I am committed to it &ndash; barring any major life-altering events &ndash; for at least another 12 months.</p>
<p>The ten days that were my unplanned break were illuminating to say the least. It feels good to be back.</p>

			 <p>I am no longer maintaining <a href="https://til.micro.blog">Today I Learned</a>.</p>
<p>Having given the project a lot of thought, specifically within the context of my life the fact is that I do not have the resources with which to make this work. This is actually a realisation on a larger scale for me personally; insofar as I do not have room for <em>any</em> such project in my life.</p>
<p>I am a carer, that is my job, and attempting to have a second job as a remote worker is an effort that is simply beyond me; I have no way of doing that with minimal effort, rather I work as hard and with as much efficiency as possible and all of this simply doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>A combination of factors leave me very much in the wrong place to attempt to continue with this effort and it is important for me to recognise this and move on. I still think Micro.blog and similar efforts are a much healthier, more sustainable alternative to the corporate silos that have come to dominate the web and hope to see more and more people come to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>The sites and account will remain but there will be no new activity at all. If anybody wants to take what&rsquo;s there, well, it&rsquo;s all easily copied anyway so there&rsquo;s nothing new about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank everybody for your support with the project, from Jean and Manton through to those who replied to posts and so on; as usual, the community on Micro.blog has proven to be pretty damn good even in these early days. You&rsquo;re all brilliant.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now I will be taking a break from blogging and generally posting on the web, and taking my time to think about what I am doing next, if anything on top of my job. I have serious doubts if anything other than volunteering will fit into my life but who knows&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s everything for now.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Internet.</p>

<p>&ndash; <a href="https://social.cheribaker.com/2019/03/13/my-new-internet.html">Cheri Baker, My New Internet Habits</a></p>
<p>Cheri has found the exact kind of mental discipline I had spoken about at the end of last year.</p>
<p>My goals, similar to her own with regard to time spent online are nowhere near closer than when I first set them out on this blog. It should be no surprised to me, then that the first two months of this year have been marked by a general downturn in my mood, my overall health really.</p>
<p>This stops now.</p>
<p>Not only have I already deactivated my personal social media accounts barring Micro.blog, I have reset my RSS feeds and am in the midst of taking a knife to the throat of any excess with regard to email, task managers (read: <a href="https://gabz.me/2019/03/09/can-a-productivity.html">Gabriel Santiago&rsquo;s take</a> on Jillianne Hamilton&rsquo;s <a href="https://jilly.ca/2019/03/can-a-productivity-nerd-live-without-a-to-do-list/"><em>Can a Productivity Nerd Live Without a To-Do List?</em></a>), and so on.</p>
<p>I am stripping away the noise, making firm decisions about my work set-up (minimised to better focus on the most immediate tasks), and filtering the crap away to stop it from getting into my mind.</p>
<p>Soon I hope to also report that I am reading more books, reading higher quality news, increasing my exercise, <em>and</em> getting much more writing done.</p>

			 <p>A question I have has been previously asked by somebody else on the Microsoft support forum thing, specifically: how can I create calendars using the Windows Calendar app.</p>
<p>From a &ldquo;Microsoft Agent | Moderator&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of the moment, we&rsquo;ll have to wait until there is an option for adding a new, personalized calendar to the Calendar app. This will be a great addition to the Calendar app, so we encourage you to submit your idea using the Feedback Hub app so that our developers can see it and consider adding this feature in future updates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; in August, 2017.</p>
<p>I&hellip; this is seriously from the company once broken up because of its monopoly in <em>computers</em>.</p>
<p>It is breathtakingly stupid to see the fucking Calendar app not have a <em>create calendar</em> feature. I spend plenty of time with my iPad or Pixel and don&rsquo;t have even one tenth the level of stress-induced headaches as I do with Microsoft&rsquo;s software.</p>
<p>Now on my to-do list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move relevant tech back to Google stuff; I have a fucking Pixel so why I am bothering with other big vendors is now beyond me.</li>
<li>Get Dropbox set up again; they and Backblaze are the only palatable major third-party developers with whom I have been satisfied with regard to these large file-based tasks.</li>
<li>Rip every single Microsoft thing I can from my digital life and continue to barely tolerate their shitty operating system, for now.</li>

			 <p>I keep going back and forth on this but as somebody who needs a computer ‚Äì even in the case of a laptop ‚Äì that can be durable and capable, I‚Äôm less convinced that I should be looking at a Mac as each day passes. A Microsoft notebook might be the way to go.</p>
<p><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/10/27/new-macbook-pros-and-the-state-of-the-mac/">This page from Michael Tsai is Exhibit A for my continued unease</a>. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m likely to get a MacBook Pro, especially not as my first Mac but the progression, or lack thereof, in the higher end models is a sign of how well the lower end models will be treated. To be frank, the price of the new MacBook Air is not enough to put me off but the terribly negligence displayed by Apple toward the Mac in general is disconcerting.</p>
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m waiting to see if they&rsquo;ll continue supplying regular updates (which to be fair, they have since the 2016 redesign) <em>and</em> revert some of the bad decisions of the past two years, and if they don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll avoid the Mac entirely and compare instead the iPad Pro to Windows laptops.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2018/10/16/the-2018-macbook-keyboards-have-the-same-old-problems/">Another set of updates from Michael Tsai</a></p>
<p>Seriously, even if I wasn&rsquo;t poor there is no way I will be able to tolerate this seemingly terrible keyboard. I write <em>way too much</em> to ever work efficiently; I barely have time enough for this work as it is!</p>

			 <p>I no longer want to be tied up in various accounts for platforms and services, to be tied to black-box style technology with which if you have any issues it <em>just</em> <em><strong>doesn&rsquo;t</strong></em> <em>work</em> and you&rsquo;re left to shrug and wait for things to get better. Of course I know that it would be ridiculous to have full and total control over every piece of technology, since that would involve constant maintenance and other investments for which the vast majority of people have no room in their already full lives. However, not every possible app and service is necessary &ndash; no, this is not an advert for Marie Kondo &ndash; and whenever I think about just how much control of my life I am handing over to corporations there is an inexorable sinking feeling, bordering on despair.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kinda shit. So I&rsquo;m not doing it anymore. Let&rsquo;s look at what I&rsquo;ve got:</p>
<ul>
<li>iCloud</li>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Amazon</li>
<li>Microsoft</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the largest arbiters of my digital life, and I would imagine relatively common for the people who are most likely to read this, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they are the only ones in my sights; I&rsquo;ll come back to the smaller platforms at a later date.</p>
<p><strong>iCloud</strong> is not going anywhere; not only is Apple the only company talking about, and acting on privacy with any sort of semblance of truth but I am also working towards a goal of trying all-in with them, for which iCloud is essential.</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> is tough. To begin with it&rsquo;s not going anywhere since I have a Pixel 2 and after trying a different Launcher (Microsoft&rsquo;s no less) found performance and stability suffered massively when compared to the default set up; apparently Google are quickly taking Apple&rsquo;s approach with regard to &ldquo;controlling the experience&rdquo;. It is highly unlikely that I&rsquo;ll be able to change my phone for another year, so that&rsquo;s Android set in place.</p>
<p>On top of this is YouTube, which is not as bad as it once was since I have massively cut the amount of regular series I watch but is still a gradual process; fortunately some of my favourite channels offer alternative methods for watching their videos, so I will work on moving over to those.</p>
<p>Beyond that I have moved my search over to a combination of DuckDuckGo and web-based resources such as directories and blogs, whilst I am happy with Fastmail for email. The only other catch is Maps, for which Apple and Bing are the best alternatives but they&rsquo;re nowhere near as easy to access as Google on my phone and <em>that</em> is where I am likely to need a map the majority of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon</strong> is likely to stay. Between an ever reliable back-up for delivered shopping and Prime it is currently in a strong position. Although, the move to Apple might negate Prime whilst attaining one of our current big domestic goals, getting a car, would put a dent in Amazon&rsquo;s power as a retailer. I would love to extract myself from their ecosystem entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> is the current backend for my task management, such as it is, but that can change easily enough over time. Other than that is Windows 10 which is in a strange position; either it&rsquo;s entirely fragile because of how much better Mac OS is <em>or</em> I&rsquo;m not all that convinced by Mac OS and Windows becomes the unquestionable default for my desktop and laptop needs. Even if the operating system stays, there will still be options for third party software, such as they are on Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong> has gone from the unquestionable social network for me to an entirely disposable, infected waste of space. My remaining account is used to convince people to join Micro.blog, a cost I am currently willing to pay since it is so entirely locked down and focused away from the maddening flood that is the inner-most thoughts of millions of people. Also: fuck Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook</strong> stopped being my hub for anything years ago; I went from deleting my years-old account, to reactivating and maintaining it in &ldquo;private mode&rdquo; (LOL), to inevitably trashing it altogether. Since then Instagram, and to a lesser degree WhatsApp remained a hook into the ecosystem but they are both gone now. Much like the rest of these huge platforms, there are better alternatives for which my mental health is eternally thankful. Also: fuck Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>I am now actively seeking out either non-account or non-services software for the bare essentials I need. We are in the era of <em>Noise</em> when it comes to software evolution for the masses and I no longer want to be weighed down by the mammoth task of moving the whole world to be plugged into one space.</p>
<p>Whilst I still believe it is true that these monopoly-abusing companies host the platforms upon which &ldquo;everybody lives&rdquo; to some extent, I simply no longer wish to bear the cost of it; I refuse to live my life by the compromised standards of other people.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be posting a follow-up to this, looking more into the future in a similar manner as I have written before now. I agree with <a href="https://www.baty.net/2019/now-that-ive-deleted-social-network/">Jack Baty with regard to where we ought to be putting our energy</a>; great, I got rid of the thing that is bad, so what is next? Let&rsquo;s all try to talk about that.</p>

<p>&hellip; I have always thought of Facebook as a <em>necessary evil</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; <a href="https://gabytron.me/2018/12/20/i-dont-know.html">Luis Gabriel Santiago Alvarado, <em>I don&rsquo;t know anymore!</em></a></p>
<p>A familiar feeling with which I empathise. The behemoths of the social web (silo platforms) have been constructed to have this exact effect on as many people as possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/garciabuxton/1506216">Joyce Garcia agrees</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s very heartening to know that I&rsquo;m not the only one struggling through decisions on the social media morass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weighing up the value of where the crowd is, or at least appears to be, against the reality of contributing to a bad thing &ndash; often definitely <em>very bad things</em> &ndash; is difficult.</p>
<p>People might say &ldquo;oh but what do you think you&rsquo;re really contributing by leaving&rdquo; but the fact remains that as more people leave, even more people feel comfortable doing so; after a few consecutive years of steady decline in activity and visible membership, these silos have no real backup plan on which to rely. They are not web-friendly at all and with that comes the lack of local copies, which means everything <em>just disappears</em>, and people will inevitably see the patently destructive core of these systems.</p>
<p>Even the people who remain in the silos will likely change their approach to them; for example, Twitter as a simple means of producing a microblog feed <em>as well as</em> RSS. Over time enough people are only likely to get smarter about these platforms, in the aggregate, that their move away from the centre of our culture, our very societies is inevitable.</p>
<p>These platforms do not need to disappear; we simply need to put them in their place.</p>

		<a href="https://swoods.net/2019/01/03/my-microblog-nonwishlist.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-01-03 21:11:33 &#43;0100">Jan 3, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last month I posted <a href="https://blog.swoods.net/2018/12/07/my-microblog-wishlist.html">my wishlist for Micro.blog</a>, outlining a number of items should they be implemented I feel would make significant contributions to the effort of making substantial improvements across the platform.</p>
<p>I built this list over time and that included removing items either implemented in that time or those that, upon reflection became less fitting for my list. Below is a list of some of these items, along with some quick thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Android</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps the most forcefully requested feature for Micro.blog at all, at least publicly. More than a few people have disregarded the platform altogether when it becomes obvious just how Apple-centric it is as far as apps are concerned.</li>
<li>Whilst I do think the platform will grow for the better with official Android support, I continue to believe it is unlikely to such an extent to be irrelevant, at least for now; if a significant portion of my list is implemented the lack of Android will soon become something of a highly visible flaw, <em>especially</em> for a platform founded on the principles of the open, inclusive web.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Windows</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the above issue with Android, although to a much lesser extent; aside from anything else, the web app is likely to be easier to access in a desktop-class browser. However, an app through which you are given a smooth and clean interface, even with just basic functionality, would be rather impressive on Windows; I say this as a lifetime user of Windows who has rarely seen third-party software worth talking about.</li>
<li>I wonder if a browser extension &ndash; at least for Firefox and Chrome, as well as Safari &ndash; would help a decent number of people for whom a Windows app would be appealing, at least in the short term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replies on hosted blog posts.</p>
<ul>
<li>This has been requested on more than a few occasions, especially from those for who the stated goals of Micro.blog are particularly attractive &ndash; for people to blog more/get back to blogging, something of a return to the old pre-social behemoth web, etc. Whilst I agree this would be a great feature, I do not believe it is important at a fundamental level for enough people to justify its theoretical status as a priority.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Metrics.</p>
<ul>
<li>This includes direct access to your Following list in a way with which most people are familiar thanks to the increasingly homogenic design of mainstream social media, the very presence of public <em>Likes</em> and/or <em>Reactions</em>, and through to the likes of built-in stats for posts. Not only do I think this would muddle the main message through which Micro.blog is promoted, I have yet to be convinced that the presence of such features ever contribute to the net positive of platforms through which people seek to <em>discuss</em> ideas and matters at hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search.</p>
<ul>
<li>Global search built right into Micro.blog. This will <em>immediately solve &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo;</em> or so it would seem when people react with shock at the lack of conventional search. Not only does the hosted search feature provide a practical option for those who are aligned with the philosophy behind Micro.blog (i.e. bloggers, including those who are more concerned with writing and posting than they are fiddling with technical toys) but the search available via Discover provides search within a focused context. For the moment that is more than enough.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;Show More&rsquo; everywhere (replies especially).</p>
<ul>
<li>I totally forgot about this. It is an example of feature parity, or lack thereof and whilst I would dearly love to see it (hi from Windows and Android üëãüèª) it&rsquo;s definitely not a deal-breaker nor a thing I believe would turn many people away, at least not in the short term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am confident there are plenty of other items I could have put here, however those are the ones I have noticed when it comes to looking at both the platform and community as a whole. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if any of these make progress ahead of my actual wishlist.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes things don&rsquo;t turn out the way you think they will. Life can be full of surprises that way. Here I am, not even a week into this year and already changes are afoot that even a few days ago I would not have expected. Let&rsquo;s get to those changes.</p>
<p>Updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posted my CSS <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonmumbles/966e5d81ca07c7588ca2e26159361179">as a Gist</a>.
<ul>
<li>I use the Marfa theme for Mumblings, with a bunch of custom CSS to twist it into the shape I prefer. The code is now on GitHub, for anybody to grab and/or leave feedback. I&rsquo;ll also soon post it to this site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Projects:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://theychoseus.wordpress.com/">They Chose Us</a> is a website dedicated to my cats, Kismet and Aria.</li>
<li><a href="https://firebyrduk.wordpress.com/">Firebyrd</a> is the home of my wife and I for our collaborative work, including our blog with which we will post updates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Increased contributions to <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog">Micro.blog on GitHub</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://photos.swoods.net">Snapshot</a> has been put on indefinite hiatus.</li>
<li>Returned to <a href="https://twitter.com/simonmumbles">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/simonmumbles">Instagram</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The future:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://til.micro.blog">Today I Learned</a> returns proper on Monday, the 14th of January.
<ul>
<li>The December edition of <strong>The Macro Report</strong> will be back before then.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>For The Weekend</strong> returns this Friday, the 4th of January.</li>
<li>Introducing: <strong>Broken Ground</strong>, a photo-based record of the public infrastructure in Liverpool.
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to highlight the condition of the streets and roads in my local area, within the relevant context to talk about why this is important and exactly why, as citizens, we should demand more from both those in positions of authorities and each other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introducing: <strong>Chronicles of Thedas</strong>, a fan-site hosting stories set in the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe.</li>
<li>Regular longer form blogging is forthcoming on Mumblings, with a reduction of shorter posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I briefly moved Mumblings, this site, from Micro.blog Hosted to Tumblr but now it is back again and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. I believe strongly in the work being done by the team, that Manton is right when he says the best future for the web is one made of smaller networks of higher quality rather than the current roster of social media behemoths.</p>
<p>I have big goals for this year and <em>Today I Learned</em> is a big part of that. I can&rsquo;t wait to restart the project on the 14th of the month, especially with the plans I have in place for further expansion.</p>
<p>I hope to get my Micro.blog Hosted photoblog back up before the end of the year, along with a couple of other blog-based ideas for which I am currently in the early planning stages. In the meantime I&rsquo;m going to keep blogging here and look forward to a year of even more people getting <em>back to blogging</em>.</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>&ndash; Simon</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>During my downtime over Christmas I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the time I am spending on writing, especially with regard to how I am moving away from constant, daily blogging and toward longer form blogging whilst increasing my time on writing-based projects.</p>
<p>Between this and the pressing need to maintain my overall health &ndash; as a carer, there is no other choice; if I do not maintain my health then I <em>cannot do my job</em> &ndash; I am looking at cutting away those activities of my day-to-day life that are in fact excessive. A <a href="http://www.tones.nz/2018/12/29/one-thing-that.html">post from <em>tones</em></a> helped me see this ambition in the sharp reality that is text and I have never felt as driven to do my best work as I do right now.</p>
<p>That being said, there is no question that my decision to move away from regular shorter blogging is an important part of this focus; don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the activity is <em>brilliant</em> and has been integral to my year-long rejuvenation thanks to which I am now well equipped to reach for my aforementioned goals. However, those goals are unlikely to be met if I continue to spend time with such regular blogging; I do not write about a specific subject or have a well established history of sharing via link blogging, or have any real access to the type of material about which I could write and thus gain traction with any sort of audience.</p>
<p>&hellip; and there it is. I want to make things <em>for people</em>. I believe the world is better when we all try to contribute to it and right now I wish to do so directly, with intention. This means posting my general, mixed blog is purely for me as a hobby, which again is great but for me unfortunately little more than excessive; a thing that has the potential to <em>drag me down</em> as it were.</p>
<p>And so my blog, this very site, will be for the longer form writing and that is fine.</p>
<p>However, there is still microblogging. Those short posts for which my favourite social media platform is named; Micro.blog. Everything about the platform is great&hellip; well, almost great. I recently <a href="https://blog.swoods.net/2018/12/07/my-microblog-wishlist.html">posted my wishlist for the platform</a> and have come to realise my main issue can be summed up in a word: friction. There&rsquo;s just too much of it still, be it foundational issues such as the lack of cross-platform apps, cross-platform parity, or a lack clear messaging about how it is safer than mainstream social media platforms&hellip; I still wouldn&rsquo;t recommend Micro.blog for the average person and so it is not quite <em>great</em>.</p>
<p>Then there is mainstream social media, specifically Twitter and Instagram. Flawed though they are, I have <a href="https://blog.swoods.net/2018/06/02/where-people-are.html">written previously about the reality that they are where people are</a>; within contexts that are important for my life this is simply true and remains so to this day. There is also another thing; they are relatively free of friction, to enough of an extent to matter.</p>
<p>To this end, a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Br84ELAg0-p/">recent post on Instagram by Federico Viticci</a> caught my eye. He is effectively <em>blogging on Instagram</em>. I guess Instagram is photoblogging by another name anyway but I had never thought much about it also as a general purpose blogging tool. Yet there it is, again, relatively friction free.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a similar story across mainstream social media:</p>
<p>Tap -&gt; tap -&gt; tap -&gt; done. Boom; on with your day.</p>
<p>This ought to be one of the big aims for Micro.blog. Not necessarily <em>as</em> friction-free but much closer to that point than it is at the moment. I believe this is possible, likely to happen, and the true moment when I can thoroughly attempt to convince people I know on a day-to-day basis to give the platform a try as a replacement for whatever social media platforms they are using.</p>
<p>A lot of these thoughts have come in the midst of a deep desire to finally push on and maintain the momentum gained from a particularly <em>busy</em> year. Cutting away excess, minimising friction for hobbies and side projects, and thus making tangible contributions through my work is the path I am taking&hellip; as a result, I will continue to think about such matters as I have written about here, make the relevant decisions, and update my blog as I do so.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been&hellip; well, one hell of a year. There are plenty of things I can&rsquo;t remember right now and that&rsquo;s OK; if it&rsquo;s important enough I&rsquo;ll remember it and make a note. In fact, I&rsquo;ve been advised by more than one person to start a diary and I&rsquo;m looking forward to doing just that.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;m currently feeling it is anticipation; after taking a break, I&rsquo;ll be back on my bullshit and determined to take on all kinds of projects, as well as shoring up my basic organisation of various tasks so that I can use more of my time to do actual work. The improved use of my time will also grant me the chance to rediscover some hobbies, which now feels like a thing I ought to be better at prioritising.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much else to say, so here are some recent updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deactivated my Now page.
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s been a great writing exercise over the past year, and has helped me with regard to making decisions about exactly what I want my blog to be, the degree to which I am involved in mainstream social media, and more. I thoroughly recommend it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Edited menu links.
<ul>
<li>This now better reflects my thinking about this site. It will change if certain features are implemented on Micro.blog but the basic structure is set.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Edited <a href="https://blog.swoods.net/about">the About page</a>.
<ul>
<li>This continues to be an ever-changing page but the rate of change has slowed over the past few months, which is good. I would prefer it to be relatively stable, mostly with changes in the future centred around <em>additions</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moved <a href="https://swoods.net">my home page</a> to WordPress.
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s almost done; just missing a single post that I&rsquo;ll have up at some point in January. Tumblr is decaying as part of its life as a social media silo, whilst Micro.blog does not currently have the features I require for this kind of page/site, and I can&rsquo;t afford the other options. Fortunately I won&rsquo;t be blogging at this site so the recent update by Automattic won&rsquo;t be a problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Started contributing to <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog">Micro.blog on GitHub</a>.
<ul>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t done very much yet but a start is better than none. I think this is the best place to focus the various discussions across the community about Micro.blog itself; hopefully this will help make it easier for people to get a good idea of the extent to which Micro.blog is developing and the actual influence the community has on that process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have also done some light work on project planning and since stopping regular work a few days ago have found it a lot easier to note down ideas and think about my exact intentions for the next few months. The various parts of my projects are moving forward together nicely and I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting some hobby projects off the ground during my break.</p>
<p>Other than that I am winding down my usual computer-based activity as a whole and will spend more time with both my iPad (reading, video, etc) and my Chromebook (limited functionality means focusing on specific, smaller task), as part of a much more relaxed approach to each day. It&rsquo;s gonna be fun!</p>
<p>With that in mind, this is the last post on Mumblings until next year. Have a fun, safe end to the year everybody. :)</p>
<p>Bye!</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>What tools are missing? I think it helps to talk about specific feature requests here. The current design is around muting, reporting, and curation of the various sections of Discover.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reply to <a href="https://micro.blog/manton/1446263">Manton&rsquo;s comment</a>:</p>
<p>Similiar to <a href="https://micro.blog/smokey/1450111">Smokey</a>, there are worries about manual curation in the future but that&rsquo;s not a thing I think is worth caring about too much for the rest of us <em>right now</em> since it&rsquo;s mostly theoretical and has too many potential solutions for which it is impossible to know what will definitely be the best approach to take.</p>
<p>Immediately, I think about how Twitter has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality filter. When I switched this on it made my timeline <em>so much better</em>. Is the Micro.blog version of this the aforementioned Safe Replies? If so, I have missed the detail on that but even so would suggest that gets promoted a lot more.</li>
<li>Keyword filters. Given the chance, you can really go deep with this and stay ahead of some of the worst offenders; people for whom dealing with is a struggle for even a team of community managers, not least because they are often part of a team themselves (4chan, etc).</li>
<li>Private mode. You can switch this on if things are getting bad, you need to take a break from using the platform, you are unable to keep an eye on things, or you want a <em>personal</em> timeline as well as a public timeline.</li>
<li>Per-person re-tweet setting. I know re-posting doesn&rsquo;t exist on Micro.blog but right now people are already posting to the timeline with a variety of posts, they just happen to be manually created and not actually built into Micro.blog itself. But I can&rsquo;t filter those out.</li>
<li>Blocking. When signed into my timeline certain people simply don&rsquo;t exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m pretty sure a bunch of that list is either already sorted &ndash; for example, muting vs blocking is largely semantics and technical differences &ndash; or simply not needed due to the structural differences between Micro.blog and Twitter.</p>
<p>If so then I guess the main issue is exactly that I <em>don&rsquo;t know that the tools are in fact not missing</em> and other than reading through <a href="https://help.micro.blog">Help</a> have no way to know; don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am happy to see people promote Micro.blog independently (I mean, duh, <a href="https://til.micro.blog">of course I do right?</a>) but my feeling wth moderation is that it should be almost <em>too</em> obvious these problems are already solved/impossible to encounter; to be perhaps as clear as I should have been all along: Micro.blog should be <em>yelling</em> about this, as it is a signal to many potential <strong>power users</strong> that the platform is ready for them right now.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In September of 2017 I had encountered a dilemma. The one all-encompassing hobby project to which I had committed everything I had available outside of my job was no longer feasible. Between the cost, energy, and time it had become a project desperately in need of a team to run it; unfortunately that was not forthcoming, not to the necessary standard and so by mid-October the project came to an end.</p>
<p>Gone. Just like that. More than seven years of my non-job life no longer evident in full public view.</p>
<p>It was strange, not least since things had become steadily worse leading up to this event and so in some ways I had already come to terms with the situation, although to this day I still regret that the project is gone and can never come back. There was a lot in that project, a website centred around creativity and community, that had taken me from my last typical day job through the chaotic first years of becoming a full-time carer. And now it was gone.</p>
<p>Needless to say I had a <em>lot</em> of energy and time now at my disposal, especially once I had taken a good two-week break to recover from such a significant event, and the first thing to come to mind was settling a question that had come often to my thoughts in the preceding years;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can I just write?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have written across different subjects in different ways onto different places across the web for a number of years, so much so that it feels odd to think of a time before I did it. The core of the aforementioned project was writing; I met my wife <em>because</em> of writing; my favourite hobbies have always involved writing, even if I do not partake. Thus the question was inevitable, since I no longer had a central project into which I could pour all of my writing energy.</p>
<p>Actually that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p><em>Almost</em> all of it.</p>
<p>You see, I have <em>always</em> dabbled in various writing-based hobbies and in the end the only constant was blogging. Whether it was a personal blog or in some other form, the act of blogging just&hellip; works for me. There&rsquo;s no other way around it; it&rsquo;s what I like doing, it&rsquo;s what primarily drew me to the silos of mainstream social media, and eventually, away from them.</p>
<p>The answer was thus inevitable; I wanted <em>my</em> site, for <em>my</em> blogging, made clearly by <em>my</em> hand. No, not the whole site, just the actual blogging. The core of it all.</p>
<p>This meant considering my options and inevitably deciding WordPress was the best way to go. It just makes sense, right?</p>
<p>Only, no, not really. Of my web-based hobbies one of my favourites is technology. Not just phones or computers but web tech also, and given that the most proficient and well organised independent writers in tech lean very much in the direction of Apple, well, that&rsquo;s where that hobby found a place. Everything from the blogs, to the news sites, to the podcasts, Twitter feeds, and more! Suddenly there was this backlog of <em>years</em> worth of fanatical people about whom I previously had no idea even existed.</p>
<p>Of course, this was <em>before</em> the project ended, by a couple of years. The specifics of the path I travelled upon to arrive to this collection of people, these connected communities, is not that important but needless to say I now had a <em>lot</em> more time and energy to fully invest my time in getting to know the people within the communities and further indulge my interests.</p>
<p>Inevitably the focus of my interests landed mostly on two people: John Gruber and John Siracusa. I&rsquo;m just that way (you know, the same way as so many other people). By way of the various outlets through which the pair would express themselves and contribute to the tech communities I came across Manton Reece, a man engaged in such independently centred ventures that I could not help but take notice. There are links at the bottom of this post to better illustrate some of the timeline here and exactly why Manton&rsquo;s work and words spoke to me strongly enough to wait.</p>
<p>You see, I wanted to blog and do it on my site, and <em>now</em> was the time! However, Manton was close to launching an initiative I had come across thanks to the aforementioned Mr. Gruber; Micro.blog. It was everything I was looking for, maybe&hellip; possibly. I wasn&rsquo;t totally sure but I knew I wanted to try it for sure. But I did not have access &ndash; I certainly threw down my email address to join the queue for getting in &ndash; and would have to wait.</p>
<p>So I wrote. I wasn&rsquo;t posting so much but I was certainly writing, blogging even, and thinking about it, and planning it&hellip; I was blogging in all but publishing. Quickly enough this changed, however, when I finally got access to Micro.blog and within ten minutes knew I wanted to do this, no matter how it might turn out.</p>
<p>Then a month passed and I felt stronger about it. Then some more weeks passed and I blogged and got more involved talking with people whom I had never previously spoken to. Then I started planning something more involved, something more than just blogging.</p>
<p>Unfortunately reality hit, specifically with regard to needing to tighten our financial belt and so the costs of my site were removed and I left Micro.blog. I returned briefly with a free WordPress hosted site plugged into my Micro.blog account but fortunately it wasn&rsquo;t long until I was able to fully return, only this time I decided to go all-in with Micro.blog. Now it was the host for my <em>whole site</em>.</p>
<p>I had launched my planned project just before having to temporarily cancel my accounts; <em>Today I Learned</em> had become public and much to my annoyance and deep shame it became immediately inactive, as a neglected project with no notice. However, my planning continued privately and I was renewed by a sense of urgency upon my return to hosted Micro.blog.</p>
<p>For me any venture about which I care a great deal is only worth my time and energy if it is for more than <em>just me</em>. I truly believe we are all at our best, as communities and societies, when we <strong>share</strong> that which we have. And I believed in Micro.blog, in not just its potential but for what it could do <strong>right now</strong>. Since I believed Today I Learned could help people share Micro.blog, I thus believed Today I Learned was worth most of my spare energy, time, and any resources I could muster.</p>
<p>It is vital that we have time for each other, that we treat and are treated with care in such a way as to presume the best and wish to teach the most. If there are resources, even beyond that which might be available via official sources, and they are made available, worked on over time, improved constantly, and renewed by new ideas therein then I think a project has a great chance of achieving the goals for which it has been created.</p>
<p>Here it is then, my ongoing effort to contribute to Micro.blog in a form beyond my individual blogging and cheerleading; <a href="https://til.micro.blog">Today I Learned</a>, an unofficial resource for Micro.blog.</p>

			 <p>This is partially in reply to <a href="https://cleverdevil.io/2018/microblog-suggestion-for-manton-and-crew">Jonathan LaCour&rsquo;s tagmoji suggestion</a> and about the issue in general, since I&rsquo;ve seen other people talk about it in the typically shallow way so many of us seem only capable of doing so.</p>
<p>Whilst it is important to avoid making it easy for people to be abused on Micro.blog, I think &ldquo;improve diversity&rdquo; is a rather shallow demand made with perhaps good intention but very little thought. We need to look deeper, at how our chosen web platforms work and the things we can do to substantially move away from a monoculture without falling into tokenism and other such behaviour.</p>
<p>First, before all else, Micro.blog needs to have a robust set of moderation tools. When even super priveleged white tech dudes are talking about how they have noticed a lack of moderation tools as compared to Twitter, then you know there is a fundamental flaw that needs to be addressed. I&rsquo;m not joking here; a <em>lot</em> of people compliment Micro.blog with comments like &ldquo;it reminds me of the early days of Twitter/Tumblr!&rdquo; and guess what, it was in those early days those platforms <strong>utterly failed</strong> to prepare for the inevitable decline into savagery employed by hateful people.</p>
<p>We are in the early days of Micro.blog; <strong>now</strong> is when we decide the hard work of future-proofing against problems we see elsewhere is not just worth it but one of our top priorities. The platform already has issues having been founded in the white tech monoculture of the US and other white Western countries, against which Jean has already worked with manual curation of the community but it is also up to us, the community itself, to push things forward; we have the freedom of non-VC demands but also the constraints of fewer resources and so must dig in and help where possible.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about different things, different people, different cultures, <em>speak with</em> people who aren&rsquo;t already a part of our lives, and never be afraid to read criticism without becoming defensive and deciding that &ldquo;the world is too sensitive&rdquo; or some other nonsense.</p>
<p>Since a part of Micro.blog&rsquo;s built-in monoculture is being so Apple-heavy, let&rsquo;s take their marketing seriously and <strong>actually think differently</strong>.</p>

			 <p>A few things for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://patrickrhone.com/2013/04/29/blogging-your-breakfast/">Blogging Your Breakfast</a>. Patrick Rhone recently linked to this 5 year-old piece of his. It&rsquo;s not just written well but also wonderfully pieced together, an excellent example of how some of the best writing of recent times has in fact come from blogging.</li>
<li><a href="https://ramblinggit.com/2018/12/blog-engines-and-indieweb-controlling-upstream/">Blog Engines and IndieWeb Controlling Upstream</a>. Brad Enslen wants to see a turnkey CMS solution provided by the IndieWeb, amongst others, as opposition to even the likes of WordPress. It is certainly an idea worth considering, especially if we&rsquo;re going to be serious about avoiding behemoth-driven monopolies of the web in the future.</li>
<li><a href="https://micro-blog-help.netlify.com/">Micro.blog Help redesign</a>. Paul Robert Lloyd has submitted his proposal for an overhaul to the official Micro.blog Help pages. You can see his thinking behind the design, and leave a comment <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/help.micro.blog/pull/16">on GitHub</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/12/11/latest-firefox-release-available-today/">Multiple Tab Organisation</a>. Mozilla released update 64 for Firefox and it includes a feature I have long wanted: the ability to manipulate multiple tabs at once.</li>
<li><a href="https://ka.micro.blog/2018/12/13/the-kiko-microblog.html">Kiko: System</a>. Kahlil Lechelt is moving his personal blog to Micro.blog and along with it has posted the edits he made to the <em>Kiko</em> theme.</li>
<li><a href="https://sounds.philpin.com/podcasts/">People First microcast</a>. John Philpin&rsquo;s first foray into the world of podcasts has well and truly launched, with episode 1 now out.</li>
<li><a href="https://tinyletter.com/John-Philpin">People First newsletter</a>. Speaking of John and his <em>People First</em> endeavour, he is also launching a newsletter.</li>
<li><a href="https://song.link/i/1446298471">Your Turn to Roll is the new theme for Critical Role</a> and it is 86 seconds of nerd joy. üòç</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the last issue of the year. For The Weekend will be back in 2019.</p>
<p>Enjoy your weekend!</p>

			 <p>A few things for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://brewster.kahle.org/2018/02/25/big-data-versus-humanity/">Big Data versus Humanity</a>. Brewster Kahle wrote this in February but it has become even more relevant with each passing day. We shouldn&rsquo;t forget those who built the frameworks of our digital world, not when they&rsquo;re still talking about it today.</li>
<li><a href="https://dori.micro.blog/2018/12/01/one-of-the.html">Frustrations at the IndyWeb conference</a>. Dori Smith thinks those involved with the IndieWeb ought to reach out to Tumblr users in particular, and it makes perfect sense. Up until the past few years Tumblr remained unique within the silos as it continued to embrace blogs, RSS, and the like.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/12/03/microblog-milestone-first.html">Micro.blog milestone: first year open to the public</a>. Manton Reece has maintained and continuously improved the various aspects of the platform, whilst the community has proven that you do <em>not</em> need to have your hand held by a closed, hostile system to have an online life.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/algorithms-dont-see/">Algorithms Don&rsquo;t See</a>. Speaking of the Micro.blog community, Patrick Rhone is a frequent contributor with gems such as this piece in which he succinctly underlines why an inhuman approach to curating the web is simply not good enough.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw/status/1053648947007361024">The web in 2018</a> (<a href="https://imgur.com/EoNd3ev">original link</a>) is a brilliant gif shared by Andy Bell. Website UX being sacrificed for cheap ad rates and lazy marketing has clearly been no solution at all to the challenges of the modern web.</li>
<li><a href="https://annie.micro.blog/2018/11/04/i-have-a.html">A Small Hymn in Praise of My Body</a>. Annie Mueller is another member of the Micro.blog community, and yet another person whose words are worthy of reading by anybody. This post has taken residence in my mind and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be going anywhere for some time yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://micro.inessential.com/2018/12/03/why-write-about.html">Why write about lunch?</a> Why yes, Brent Simmons <em>is</em> on Micro.blog. Huh, funny that! In this short posts he hits a number of great points in answering the stated question.</li>
<li><a href="https://gabytron.me/2018/12/04/are-there-any.html">Are there any rules?</a> Another great question from yet another member of the Micro.blog community. Luis Gabriel Santiago Alvarado has gradually returned to blogging over the past year and with posts like this it&rsquo;s easy to see why. <a href="https://micro.blog/Gaby/1265974">You can answer his question, if you like</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.restlesslens.me/2018/12/07/working-around-the.html">Pretty Damn Futuristic</a>. Jeremy has found, like me, AirPods to be pretty damn good. <em>Especially</em> when used within the Apple ecosystem.</li>
<li><a href="https://xkcd.com/1361/">Randall Munroe&rsquo;s excellent comic immediately came to mind</a> the moment I came across the latest news about Google Hangouts and Allo.</li>
<li><a href="https://thetruesize.com">The True Size</a> is an excellent web app to help you keep check of your mental model of the world, made by James Talmage and Damon Maneice who were in turn inspired by <em>The West Wing</em> which in itself is often a very good thing indeed.

<li><a href="https://micro.blog/cm/1283349">h/t Chad Moore</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://ramblinggit.com/2018/11/populism-and-todays-social-tech-vs-blogging/">Populism and Today&rsquo;s Social Tech vs. Blogging</a>. Brad Enslen is hitting out of the park again with his thinking on the web, starting with this first part of a series.</li>
<li><a href="https://indieseek.xyz/links/index.php?TID=pages-linktous">Indieseek Directory</a>. Speaking of Brad, he is building a directory of his own to which you can link or even add its search to your site. Efforts like this are how we rebuild the web and move it away from the centralised, silo behemoths.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/titles-with-full-text-online">MetPublications</a> is the archive created by The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, with which you can access decades worth of publications on art history <strong>for free</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="https://mandaris.micro.blog/2018/12/01/going-to-give.html">Advent Calendar of Compliments</a>. Mandaris Moore is doing a great thing for the holiday season, with yet another brilliant contribution to the Micro.blog community. You <a href="https://micro.blog/mandaris/1222550">can talk to him about it on Micro.blog</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/g0rmyr/status/1068986379118497794">Critters Unplugged</a> is a phenomenal gathering of Critical Role cosplayers. Just look at all of that colour. üòç</li>

			 <p>I have been taking notes for this wishlist for some time. Two things have stopped me from writing it up and posting:</p>
<ol>
<li>Time and energy. I have spent more of it on <a href="https://til.micro.blog/2018/11/23/updates-recent.html">making</a> <a href="https://blog.swoods.net/archive/">other</a> <a href="https://firebyrduk.wordpress.com/">things</a>, being a believer in the idea that the best position from which to criticise is that of creation, or put another way: I feel much more comfortable writing a critique-based wishlist for Micro.blog now that I&rsquo;ve significantly increased my exposure to working on different projects.</li>
<li>Frankly, Manton, Jean, and John have all worked their arses off to improve Micro.blog in a variety of ways. Not only have I been able to remove items from the list but I have also been exposed to ideas for Micro.blog I had not previously come near to thinking about.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now here I am, not only more convinced of just how right the entire idea of Micro.blog truly is &ndash; after all, it&rsquo;s not just about Micro.blog but the potential in ideas similar to the platform insofar as sharing the same ideals &ndash; but also newly motivated to attempt to make a constructive contribution. As such, here is the list:</p>
<p>(<em>Note:</em> I have published three posts around this subject, all of which play a part in the list. Links: <a href="https://blog.swoods.net/2018/04/18/quick-microblog-wishlist.html">Quick list</a>; <a href="https://blog.swoods.net/2018/08/31/what-microblog-needs.html">Needs</a>; <a href="https://blog.swoods.net/2018/09/23/microblog-thoughts-thereon.html">Thoughts</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive support of features centred around accessibility;
<ul>
<li>Easier <code>alt</code> tags, VoiceOver support, and a robust editor are some of the necessary pieces to making Micro.blog as accessible as possible.</li>
<li>Some improvements were recently made on iOS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thorough user moderation;
<ul>
<li>The ability to control as much of your timeline as possible is essential to making Micro.blog a viable space in which people can comfortably invest their time and energy.</li>
<li>Earlier this year the web and Mac apps gained muting and reporting tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multi-account support on the web.</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts;
<ul>
<li><em>ctrl+enter to post</em>, etc. The lack of these options on the web is jarring, especially in a post editor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mentions;
<ul>
<li>When replying in a thread, you ought to be given the option to reply-all or not.</li>
<li>Autofill when typing a username.</li>
<li>Autofill has come to iOS, when creating new posts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Editing replies;
<ul>
<li>Even if there was a limit applied via time and/or length.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conversations;
<ul>
<li>Some form of threaded replies is needed.</li>
<li>Links to replies go to the actual reply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Better responsive design;
<ul>
<li>On the web it should be possible to make the browser window smaller without cutting off parts of the site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dark mode.</li>
<li>humans.txt;
<ul>
<li>An option to set this as a special page aligns perfectly with the web-centred philosophy around which Micro.blog was built.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IndieWeb support;
<ul>
<li>Like</li>
<li>Repost</li>
<li>Selected entry (for quoting)</li>
<li>Emoji link share &ndash; this is available in Omnibear, as a custom alternative to <em>Like</em>.</li>
<li>IndieWeb support has improved greatly throughout the year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feedback;
<ul>
<li>When taking an action there should be better, more obvious feedback from the site.</li>
<li>For example; taking you to your reply once it has been posted.</li>
<li>This has improved throughout the year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cross-posting per post;
<ul>
<li>A version of this exists on iOS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hosted;
<ul>
<li>Theme editing &ndash; some way to connect owner of blog to theme controls when they are browsing the site.</li>
<li>Improve performance of saving changes to pages, posts, and the theme.</li>
<li>Drafts &ndash; the &lsquo;Preview&rsquo; feature is good but the ability to temporarily save posts would be fantastic.</li>
<li>Greater variety of payment plans.</li>
<li>Either an expanded trial or limited posting ability for free accounts.</li>
<li>A free <em>test blog</em> on which you can preview changes to pages and themes, and send out posts but they never make it to the timeline.</li>
<li>Discounted bulk blog subscriptions. (I am unashamedly biased towards this, heh.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Help;
<ul>
<li>Add search. This has been mitigated by the recently improved homepage but over time a search box will become necessary for most people.</li>
<li>Further additions from other sources &ndash; ex: <a href="http://www.manton.org/2017/10/micro-blog-special-pins.html">this &lsquo;pins&rsquo; post from Manton</a> &ndash; which has already happened a little.</li>
<li>Make sure the breadth of blog-centred web is covered.</li>
<li>For example: self-hosted WordPress, hosted WP, multisite WP, shared hosting WP.</li>
<li>WP has the potential to lack compatibility due to different hosts implementing their own version for whatever reason.</li>
<li>Micro.blog should, even if gradually, cover more and more of this ground until everything is up-to-date and quickly updated whenever different versions of WP are updated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Broadly;
<ul>
<li>Where possible, all of these updates should be available to third-party apps.</li>
<li>The web MUST be the canonical version. App-centric approaches are in direct opposition to any substantial support of the open web, <em>especially</em> when they are Apple-only efforts, mostly due to the cost barrier.</li>
<li>This year has seen <em>a lot</em> of improvements to the web app, which is great! Long may it continue.</li>
<li><em>Example of Apple-centric approach</em>: the Micro.blog home page for logged-out visitors has a screenshot of the Mac App.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There might be things I&rsquo;m missing but there is one glaring omission; Android. I have mentioned the Apple-heavy support of Micro.blog but not listed Android, or any other platform. The reality is an official Android app is all but impossible in the current circumstances, whilst third-party efforts are ongoing but appear to be particularly difficult to implement; this is of course not at all exclusive to Micro.blog but remains a fact even so.</p>
<p>Windows and even Linux support have also been spoken about by developers but for now the web is the answer for those of us outside of Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem, and I believe some of the items on my list would further soften the blow that is a lack of cross-native app support.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢  ‚Ä¢  ‚Ä¢</p>
<p>Micro.blog recently hit <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/12/03/microblog-milestone-first.html">the first year of public release</a> and it is fair to say it has come a <em>long</em> way in those 12 months, let alone the progress Manton has made from the earliest days of the Kickstarter project. I for one have found <em>just</em> the right place for my life online, to such an extent that I now begrudgingly use the mainstream silos of the web for work and do everything I can to avoid them in a personal context. For that reason and that reason alone I have spent plenty of my time on <a href="https://micro.blog/simonwoods">the timeline</a>, <a href="https://blog.swoods.net">my hosted site</a>, <a href="https://photos.swoods.net">my new photoblog</a>, and <a href="https://micro.blog/til">Today I Learned</a>.</p>
<p>And, like Micro.blog itself, I&rsquo;m just getting started.</p>

<p>This is kind of an ‚ÄúiTunes on Windows‚Äù moment.</p>

<p>&ndash; <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/11/30/142712.html">Manton Reece on Apple Music coming to Alexa devices</a></p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. iTunes on Windows + iPod = my only exposure to Apple previous to the stage in my life when I actively got involved with the Apple enthusiast community, and those two things made a lasting impression.</p>
<p>In fact, earlier this year I tried going all-in on Google, Android phone, the works, and that included not just dumping Apple Music but also iTunes; in the end, every other music player grated on me and that was in comparison to iTunes <em>for Windows</em>. Things have become bad enough overall that I have now returned to my goal of attempting to go all-in with Apple, starting with AirPods (they&rsquo;re <em>fucking awesome</em>) and the 2018 iPad.</p>
<p>With moves like this Apple could build up a buffer of goodwill and for sure help themselves with future mistakes; the past few years has seen most of the heavy criticism aimed at the company come <em>after</em> other mistakes and missteps were made. Too much negative momentum has built up over time and making as many steps into cross-platform waters as they can will likely help negate that momentum, even if only as a starting point in the effort to do so.</p>

<p>I really think hosted Micro.blogs need an on-blog comment system so non-blogging friends can comment. If you are coming from FB, you can tell your friends about RSS readers and keeping in touch, but if they can‚Äôt converse with you it‚Äôs all for nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; <a href="https://rantinggit.com/2018/11/28/i-really-think.html">Brad Enslen</a></p>
<p>If it worked with webmentions and the like then sure, even still that would mean needing to prompt people to get that set up for themselves &ndash; the infrastructure for this already exists through Micro.blog accounts and IndieWeb custom domain usernames &ndash; which flies in the face of that which people have been trained; easy, frictionless, embedded, centralised.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think closed Micro.blog commenting (like WordPress comments) does much to change enough of the existing problems with commenting systems; as one of the stated goals for Micro.blog is to encourage people to own the things they post, I&rsquo;m not sure <em>ease of use</em> is a strong enough factor to encourage such a thing. Also, if it was done similar to WordPress comments we get back to the point where it&rsquo;s down to the person running the blog to manage comments &ndash; personally, I&rsquo;d rather take a walk in traffic &ndash; and invariably includes the complications inherent therein; aside from anything else it often looks cluttered and unintuitive.</p>
<p>If the option to display comments comes to hosted sites a good first step might be the aforementioned messaging to encourage people to use their own domain or a Micro.blog account for commenting. Beyond that, I think it&rsquo;s a case of waiting for other commenting systems based around similar ideals to surface; the open web, ownership, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Although, if Micro.blog commenting were to become that in and of themselves I wouldn&rsquo;t complain. I mean, I would be shocked to see such a thing since, seriously, there is no skeevy VC money here or soul-destroying <em>monetisation</em> through which Micro.blog could gain a team and work at the level required to also build a separate, complimentary commenting system.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; <a href="https://micro.blog/JohnPhilpin/1172255">John Philpin</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about the best they&rsquo;ve ever done&hellip; I&rsquo;m talking about the <em>bottom standard</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The relative lack of movement with regard to hardware updates.</li>
<li>Further dumbing down their own software for no discernible reason&hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; <em>whilst</em> making clumsy changes that affect third-party developers badly.</li>
<li>Ramping up prices overall.
<ul>
<li>Not just premium but an actual <em>fuck you</em> to all but the wealthy few who care.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The utter failure in managing optics for their messes &ndash; the &ldquo;PRIVACY TECH COMPANY THAT CARES&rdquo; <em>cannot</em> be forgiven for <em>failures in optics</em>.</li>
<li>&hellip; and the stupid book, the ridiculous fuck ups with leaks, the iPhone battery bullshit.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, <em>come on</em>. Of course they have always fucked up, that&rsquo;s to be expected since <em>people run these companies</em> but Jobs set a platform and Tim Cook has missed a great chance to create a <em>cavernous</em> difference in quality and stability between them and the competition, a <strong>true and undeniable justification for the premium label</strong>.</p>
<p>Now of course, I am an outsider (I have an iPad and AirPods &ndash; both of which are brilliant) who has listened to a bunch of Apple tech podcasts and read Apple punditry for the past few years. If over the next year, as I get more Apple hardware and immerse myself further into their ecosystem, things aren&rsquo;t as bad as they seem (see: the list above) then great, turns out perception does not match reality. At that point, despite the failings of the people in my position I will <em>still</em> lay some of the blame at Apple&rsquo;s feet; too many times when they engage in any sort of PR action it is either neutral to the point of irrelevant or so clumsy you&rsquo;d think they were a bunch of young idiots running their first company, and <em>that</em> is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Apple has already decided they can just do all of the app-focused editorial in-house. How long before they start scooping up app developers and signficantly increase the number of first-party apps?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not at all confident the average iPhone buyer (i.e. Apple&rsquo;s most valuable customer) could care less about third-party apps and so find it difficult to see them receiving real pushback for that kind of move.</p>

			 <p>I recently stumbled across <a href="https://snarfed.org/2018-09-04_i-dont-hang-out-on-the-internet"><em>I don&rsquo;t hang out on the internet</em></a> by Ryan Barrett and it hit a few marks for me, in different ways. One of the most significant effects being on the web has had on me is to ask a question: How much of this do you want?</p>
<p>My primary use of the web was to connect with people, much like Ryan explained, as a young adult looking for like-minded people. However, my relationship with the web has transformed to the point where I now feel as if I have both feet in different worlds; on one hand I adore the web enthusiast community &ndash; open web, IndieWeb, Micro.blog, etc &ndash; not least because without that collective behaviour it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine the web would be relevant at all; on the other hand I love seeing non-web enthusiasts take part of their physical lives and share it with, well, more people than was previously possible. I connect in many ways with both sets of people and the intensity of my preference changes depending on a number of factors, not least of which is my mood.</p>
<p>However, the problem is the toll this can have on my energy and time, and frankly, on my mental health. Of course, &ldquo;Just take a break!&rdquo; is great advice and it&rsquo;s always important to take a step back from any particular activity, even if only once in a while. I need more than that; my goal to work remotely requires focus, organised time, restraint; is that possible whilst investing time in a number of enthusiast activities? I&rsquo;m convinced it is not.</p>
<p>The choice is therefore: what do I cut? Over the next couple of months I&rsquo;ll be making difficult decisions with this, as the majority of middle-aged people also seem to do so.</p>
<p>Well&hellip; I have at least experienced all kinds of different joy in the process of indulging in a variety of interests and passions over the past several years. Things could have been much worse.</p>

			 <p>This is a previous version of my <em>About</em> page on my hosted Micro.blog site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simon Woods is a man of dubious taste with little to no skill for effectively managing time, space, or any other dimension. He also likes to use words incorrectly, if for nothing else than the exquisite joy of seeing people care enough to get annoyed about it. There‚Äôs also a chance that doing the ‚Äòwords‚Äô thing is difficult and laziness feels so damned good. He‚Äôs lucky enough to live with Claire Field, an infinitely patient and dizzyingly talented fianc√©e, in a city that is known for a collection of insects who continue to be quite popular many years after their death. Every day is made even better by the company of two cats, one of a delicate nature and the other of a kind you are likely to see with the Muppets.</p>
<p>The effort to work is often characterised by an inability to make substantial progress one way or the other but Simon has at least improved his ability to recognise this in a practical manner. There are points when it seems best to give up but then life wouldn‚Äôt be very interesting without challenges, and so he perseveres. To this day it is likely his most impressive achievement.</p>
<p>For those who have taken the time to read this he apologises. Please know that it was excruciating to write.</p>
<p>Especially the three paragraphs before this one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; I was, uh, trying something. If it taught me one thing it&rsquo;s that I much prefer to write creatively within the context of specific projects, especially when it comes to writing fiction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still thinking a lot about my pages and my blog and how it all fits together; I&rsquo;m leaning towards having a single page as a better representation for both what I am now doing <em>and</em> what I am aiming to do. The question now is: how do I create such a page?</p>
<p>I have a custom domain &ndash; whilst I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;d like to thank <a href="https://manton.org">Manton</a> for introducing me to the idea that as long as you have your domain, the guts of the site are largely irrelevant; it has clarified my thinking <em>a whole fucking lot</em> &ndash; so I think I&rsquo;ll start with something that&rsquo;s free and then upgrade later when possible, should there be something else I need from such a site.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have tweaked both my <a href="http://simonmumbles.micro.blog/about/">current About page</a> and <a href="http://simonmumbles.micro.blog/feeds/">my Subscribe page</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I just <a href="http://til.micro.blog/2018/11/23/updates-recent.html">released a bunch of updates</a> for <a href="https://micro.blog/til">@til</a> and now I&rsquo;m ready to ramp up my efforts on other projects. As I <a href="https://simonmumbles.micro.blog/2018/10/14/autumn-falls.html">previously mentioned</a> my blogging quantity will decrease but in place of that I will produce higher quality, focused work. My ability to do this has in fact been jump-started by my renewed blogging over the past year, which is another thing for which I can thank Manton Reece; seriously dude, you both got more blogging from me <em>and</em> helped me find the focus required to make hard decisions&hellip; for that, I can&rsquo;t thank you enough.</p>
<p>There are times when it becomes easy to forget the things we do for each other as people. Right now it is important for me remember that Manton, Jean, and the whole Micro.blog community has done for me that which I truly needed. Thank you all. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

			 <p>One of my reasons for feeling trepidation at giving Apple a try beyond iPhone and iPad is that there is <strong>no</strong> cheaper option to try. There is no entry-level model; this is simply not something Apple are interested in offering to people.</p>
<p>So if I run into <a href="https://twitter.com/syneryder/status/1066258885923635200">similar problems to that which Kohan Ikin has experienced</a> I&rsquo;ll be pretty well screwed. After saving for a computer for months and then relying on it to get work done, they would basically have me by the balls and only create <em>more</em> stress of a kind that is damaging in different ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just use what you&rsquo;ve got&rdquo; or &ldquo;Just get another computer&rdquo; you might say; right, fair enough, but I am already using what I have got &ndash; which, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, is quite good &ndash; and the fact is that I am talking about my <em>livelihood</em> here, not just something to fart around on with the browser and email and shitty games or something. The change to the Mac might not actually work; it might be the case that I prefer Windows but even then just to <em>try</em> the Mac there is still this potential for more stress than I am sure I have the capacity with which to deal.</p>
<p>Damn it. Technology needs to hurry up and become better overall and more accessible.</p>

<p>John is as concerned as I am with regard to the depth of vile incompetence at which both the Big Tech and political entities of our societies are allowed to operate at, <em>and</em> continue to thrive in the process.</p>
<p>The one thing that continues to surprise me is just <em>how surprised</em> so many online commenters are about this; as if corruption has not been at the heart of our so-called democracies for, well, <em>ever</em>.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing commenters can do, especially with the reach of Kottke and the like, is help build the alternatives and shine a light on the ways in which things can be improved. I understand that what&rsquo;s in the news is what gets people&rsquo;s eyeballs but at some point we all have to be accountable for improvement rather than mere observation.</p>

<p>I think pushback against Instagram is coming, as more people who have already left Facebook also remember that Instagram has the same leadership, and the platform is far enough off track that even the founders have left.

</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/11/15/breaking-up-facebook.html">Manton Reece, <em>Breaking up Facebook is up to us</em></a></p>
<p>One of the things that always keeps me away from going back to the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; option of <em>just</em> using social media is the reminder that the same people who like to brag about &ldquo;indpendent thought&rdquo; and &ldquo;independent speech&rdquo; also use Facebook heavily for promotion and the like. A platform that so readily allows this illogical behaviour to thrive, and cause so much destruction, is never a platform any actual independently motivated person ought to invest in let alone trust.</p>
<p>I look forward to the continued growth of a diverse, independent ecosystem of <em>small</em> and flexible platforms to replace mainstream social media. Now more than ever we need the people making these platforms to understand that people do use these big platforms for real, practical reasons and the only way to move power away from such deeply flawed platforms is to provide <em>usable</em> alternatives.</p>
<p>We are only at the beginning of these efforts but speed is of the essence; the mainstream platforms hold sway over enough of the right people to damage the lives of millions of people, and those of us privileged enough to be born into the ill-gotten wealth of the tech-heavy Western world <em>must</em> lead the charge for higher standards across the board.</p>

<p>&ndash; <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/10/23/wordpresss-gutenberg-vs.html">Manton Reece asks a question with which the people at Automattic may not be overly concerned</a></p>
<p>I can only imagine the modern backlash against the social media giants have fuelled this kind of development, especially with the recent news regarding Facebook&rsquo;s deception with their promises about video. Modern blogging and CMS services do <em>so</em> much of the work for you whilst you are able to maintain varying degrees of ownership and control as compared to the silos.</p>
<p>As such the decision to opt for such services is a no-brainer for anybody attempting to make money from publishing in any significant way.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those of us who aren&rsquo;t looking to maintain particularly complex websites but prefer to focus on <em>writing</em> have plenty of choices of our own, not least of all <a href="https://micro.blog/">Manton&rsquo;s own Micro.blog</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m kind of lonely. Initially this was largely a matter of choice; even though I am comfortable around other people, often have few issues talking to strangers, and have never gone out of my way to avoid others in a last-second panic or any such situation the truth is I enjoy my own company. Quite a lot, in fact. My preferred environment with friends does not involve a room full of people or more than just a few people at that; once I get past about five or six people the situation becomes much less enjoyable, specifically with regard to actually spending quality time with my friends. The result of all of this being I now find myself somewhat detached from what is considered regular contact with other people and frankly it has been disconcerting to suddenly realise I haven&rsquo;t had a face-to-face conversation with another person outside of my family for, well, longer than I can even remember right now.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m definitely lonely. It&rsquo;s not as bad as it might be, all things considered, and there are certainly other people for whom this is a serious problem; I&rsquo;m not going to pretend I have such a deep problem but it&rsquo;s still there, tapping me at the back of my head on an increasingly regular basis as of late. I guess that&rsquo;s middle age calling to say hello?</p>
<p>One of the big reasons as to why this has not become a serious problem <em>and</em> an issue I have become willing to tackle head-on is, simply, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Podcasts">podcasts</a>.</p>
<p>There are hours and hours and hours&hellip; <em>and hours</em> of conversations between all kinds of people, in different contexts, from years into the recent past and more available with each passing week. They are there, all thanks to podcasts &ndash; and of course, mostly thanks to RSS &ndash; just waiting to be picked up, and whichever app you choose it is one of the most friction free media consumption experiences available across the whole of the web. Podcasts are fantastic, a whole world of people&rsquo;s lives into which you can lose yourself, or even simply dip your toe for a limited experience.</p>
<p>The breadth of shows available can feel overwhelming but once you get started it soon becomes apparent all this means is that you are going to find something you enjoy, often more than one thing and in different ways, thus offering at least a partial answer to loneliness; companionship. To be in the presence of others in a manner that is both immediate and distant is tantalising to those of us for whom <em>&ldquo;simply talking to people&rdquo;</em> is either difficult or simply not enough; no amount of small talk will make me your friend, nor you mine. Before you know it, you can see the seemingly innumerable supply of podcasts as a number of potential balms to soothe whatever aches your heart on any given day and that is a <em>wonderful</em> feeling to experience.</p>
<p>When considering this idea, this potential&hellip; this entire world all of its own there is a temptation to think of this as a bad idea; a distraction from <em>The Real World</em> like much of the rest of the web. Whilst there is some truth to this it is also important to consider that there have been distractions from the world available to us for a long time, much longer in fact than many who would criticise the culture of our modern day care to admit; doing so presents an obvious hole in their reasoning, if we assume the attacks are as shallow as the most popular opinions so often tend to be. As such podcasts could be considered as simply another choice for people to make, a different act to take from the ever-growing list in the modern media-driven world within which we live.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that feeling lonely is not an illness, not always a bad thing, and certainly not a social ill endangering humanity but it certainly can make life much more difficult to live; to be within reach of the rest of the world and yet feel entirely alone is a conflict with which many people are unlikely prepared to wrangle. To ease that difficulty is no small things and I have found podcasts can greatly aide in this task to a degree that much of the rest of the web cannot come close. And for that, for giving me at least the beginnings of a path away from such strange solitude I am forever grateful to those who make this type of media possible. For that, I can only say&hellip;</p>
<p>Podcasts are awesome.</p>

			 <p>This is a post about updates in a number of ways.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the overview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theme: Dark
<ul>
<li>The last version of this site, on WordPress, had a dark theme and I liked it a lot. Now this version of the site, on Micro.blog, has a dark theme and again I am happy with how it has turned out.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://coreassistance.com/">Core Assistance</a> was once again an invaluable resource for this work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social accounts:
<ul>
<li>I am relieved to settle on my usage; minimal and specific.</li>
<li>This blog remains core, with Micro.blog being my primary social network; it is the only site where I will not be motivated to move conversation elsewhere, as compared to the alternatives from the mainstream, silo parts of the web.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://firebyrduk.wordpress.com">Firebyrd</a> is a new site from my fianc√©e and I, wherein we link out to our joint projects and provide updates about them. On Micro.blog: <a href="https://micro.blog/firebyrd">@firebyrd</a></li>
<li><a href="https://simonphotos.micro.blog">Snapshot</a> is my new photoblog.</li>
<li><a href="https://til.micro.blog">TIL</a>:
<ul>
<li>Menu;
<ul>
<li>Contact moved into About.</li>
<li>Updates removed as it is already in the About page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About page reorganised.</li>
<li>Continued activity, with newer post types and more imminent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="taking-a-break">Taking a break</h2>
<p>Now for the detailed part, specifically with regard to a theme I&rsquo;ve seen lately on my timeline. Namely that of time, focus, and how I can better utilise both of these things to live my life in the way I truly wish.</p>
<p>Daily blogging is first. I&rsquo;m still writing but microblog posts will become infrequent; this has already been somewhat true so isn&rsquo;t too much of a change. It could soon become even more obvious, however. This includes replies in conversations, which is the most difficult thing to step away from; I continue to read conversations on Micro.blog at least as much as anything else I read, perhaps even more.</p>
<p>Next is podcasts. Until recently I had over 130 subscriptions, and whilst that is a misleading number in some ways (included completed shows, infrequently posted shows, and shows in which I did not listen to every new episode) it reflected a problem that had crept upon me. Podcasts are wonderful, even more so than video on the web as far as I&rsquo;m concerned but the truth is that they often carry a hefty time investment and are so very good at plugging into my mind; they had become an example of other people&rsquo;s thoughts intruding upon my own in a manner that is not conducive to good focus.</p>
<p>I am now subscribed to my 7 favourite shows and even then the highest volume is once per week, with only one opinion-based concept that has the potential to intrude upon my own thoughts. This number may again decrease but I have already felt the benefits of this reduction.</p>
<p>TV and YouTube are in a similar position to podcasts; the former has been severely cut down over the past year (weekly viewing is all but non-existent) whilst the latter is centred around a handful of channel subscriptions, the majority of which have irregular schedules. I have also deleted all but one manual playlist and cut my <em>Watch Later</em> playlist down to a third of its previous size. There is no news-based watching happening at all, whilst opinion-based productions are carefully chosen rather than casually watched.</p>
<p>TV will become almost exclusively just the shows I watch with Claire.</p>
<p>When it comes to reading the web, I am finally choosing to organise my RSS subscriptions and will form an <em>essential</em> collection of feeds for daily reading. This is my primary source of web reading, the medium I have discovered to be the very best.</p>
<p>I am no longer reading social media from a personal account and although those few accounts still exist they are now essentially frozen for the foreseeable future. My work accounts continue to exist, used largely only for posting.</p>
<p>My use of technology has played a part with these changes, inevitably. The introduction of my first iPad into my set up has helped to re-affirm a more focused approach to my average day, whilst my phone software has been minimalised (as can <a href="http://simonmumbles.micro.blog/uploads/2018/a3454e6f14.jpg">be seen here</a>). I&rsquo;m also finally going to make a regular habit of taking my laptop to places outside of the home for writing and light tasks, the two types of work to which my Chromebook is limited.</p>
<p>Work has become an area of great improvement, specifically from the viewpoint of there being a much healthier integration into my life. By work I mean that which I am attempting to achieve separately from my primary job as a carer.</p>
<p>I am more focused than ever on completing my objectives with various projects, including blogging middle-to-long length posts which are being made in a more substantial state of mind. This is a sharp contrast to the ephemeral snack-sized efforts encouraged by the demands of <em>The Feed</em>.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I have never felt less comfortable with the closed silo, short-term, empty information based web; not only do I disagree on a wider philosophical front but it is personally offensive for this to be considered &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and &ldquo;the standard&rdquo;. That we take this idea, this construct built around sterile ideas and shallow thinking and we call it <em>good</em> is a damning indictment of this point in time, <em>this</em> version of society as we know it.</p>
<p>The other deciding factor in my decision is that I am both needed and wanted more than ever in the physical world, for which I am grateful but also aware of the tangible reality here; to function well is to be focused and clear, deliberate and without a constant stream of small distractions &ndash; I will remember this time in my life and it won&rsquo;t be because of the latest viral video, tweetstorm, or latest round of <em>Lighting The Dumpster Aflame</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.inthemargins.ca/fall-is-here">Preparing for the fall</a> is a meditation of sorts on the inevitable change brought about by the passing of time. Sameer strikes words to page like no other and this is certainly no exception.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1tiwbzkOjQyr6-gqJ8r29j_rJkR49uDN">Handbooker Helper</a> is a video series by the folks at Critical Role. Whether you&rsquo;re new to the hobby or looking to refresh your knowledge, it&rsquo;s a great way to quickly gain a grasp on the fundamentals of tabletop role-playing.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/dGv-_8tk8g4?t=11428">Pumat Sol</a> is a character in the Critical Role series. Introduced here in the second campaign, the NPC is brought to life in a way that only Matt Mercer could manage; I&rsquo;ve yet to see a limit to his creative talents.</li>
<li>Kohan Ikin is working on a desktop app for Micro.blog, and he&rsquo;s attempting <a href="https://twitter.com/syneryder/status/1044321219732942848">to make it an actual cross-platform option</a>. He&rsquo;s also on Micro.blog (<a href="https://micro.blog/syneryder">@syneryder</a>) and providing updates on the progress of the project.</li>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a lot of good spirit <a href="https://micro.blog/joshsharp/907582">in this conversation</a> but so far I&rsquo;ve only seen a suggestion to give Manton and Jean more work that is not the user-side platform itself; now instead they would spend time on better organising the feedback system for users. I think this is a good idea but should not be a priority at the moment, since there are still a few good things Manton and Jean are more than capable of implementing without the attached better organised feedback system.</p>
<p>Whilst things take longer or might frustrate certain people, this is the reality of a smaller operation (as I&rsquo;m sure Josh knows much better than I do, what with his and Belle&rsquo;s company) and at this point I don&rsquo;t think it would be good for Micro.blog to move closer to, say, the whole federated system where lots of people easily have lots of input &ndash; Mastodon is the well-known example of this and it&rsquo;s just a mess as compared to Micro.blog.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an assumption in Josh&rsquo;s post that I have seen elsewhere; Micro.blog is presented as a viable alternative social network. I understand where this assumption comes from but it is just not true and so at a fundamental level a lot of these ideas are coming from a false position. The whole point, in so far as I have understood it <em>is</em> for individual ownership of your content to be the relevant point of difference (from social media) and then Micro.blog is <em>a</em> social layer to help connect those blogs upon which you have ownership, should you wish to do so.</p>
<p>And, frankly, I like that. Not least because it has been built and maintained in a way that does not involve Manton and Jean coming out with big statements about how &ldquo;everybody can be involved&rdquo; without evidence of that actually working, but rather it is a <em>focused</em> effort, transparently maintained on the most appropriate front; where people can find it <em>usable</em> before anything else.</p>
<p>Whilst I appreciate the spirit of &ldquo;super ease of input from the community will solve lots of things!&rdquo; I think this only has tangible worth if the platform is in a better condition than it currently is, both from a user perspective and from the developer perspective. I do not think it will work if it comes from a tiny team and a platform still in need of usability upgrades, <em>especially</em> because the strength of the endeavour is in its patient, calm approach; opening the floodgates should not happen, at least not yet.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t read the reviews or much of anything about the iPhone, only listened to a few podcast episodes about it but even then there hasn&rsquo;t been any great depth with regard to the bigger picture; this makes sense since the XS line has literally <em>just</em> been released.</p>
<p>Before I dive into the variety of voices who are more likely to at least touch on the big picture issues, I have been thinking about it a little. This is odd since I don&rsquo;t have one and won&rsquo;t have the opportunity for at least another 12 months but hey, I&rsquo;m odd like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inevitable that the yearly upgrade loses value, at least from an <em>upfront and obvious</em> perspective. Even a three-year cycle now feels like the best thing to suggest to most people; I mean, are any of the X series <em>that much better</em> than the 7?</p>
<p>Obviously there is something of a culture around the yearly upgrade cycle &ndash; as well as <em>billions of dollars</em> therein &ndash; and it has been interesting to see a number of people clashing with the changing reality of these devices but the fact remains; most people don&rsquo;t need a pro computer, and as the smallest computers capable of a variety of tasks become more powerful they inevitably <em>become</em> pro. At some point the calls for Apple to use the &lsquo;Pro&rsquo; moniker become justified, in fact they might have missed an opportunity with this generation, and that comes along with something even the most resistant pundit will have to admit:</p>
<p>The brand new iPhone is in fact not for most people.</p>

			 <p><strong>In reply to: <a href="https://www.serenawho.com/2018/09/13/why-i-hate-advertisements/">Why I hate Advertisements</a> by <a href="https://micro.blog/vishae">@vishae</a></strong></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a thing I think is important; now we can actually ask these questions. Back in the day before the web and ideas centred around mainstream social networks, what did you have? Vote with your money? Well that excluded a <em>hell</em> of a lot of people. Now people can voice opposition and <em>it can actually be heard</em>.</p>
<p>For all of the bad of modern advertising, there is also good advertising out there <em>and</em> the bad stuff can now be voted against in ways that are much more inclusive; for example, boycotting a social media site&rsquo;s most valuable accounts, just to pick an example out of the air.</p>
<p>We need to be realistic about a lot of the noise being made regarding advertising, privacy, social media and so on; much of it comes from people who previously were unaware of such issues, and in past generations many people lived in ignorant bliss. Again, I am thankful this has changed, it is great to see people asking questions and being heard and <em>actually taking part in such important discussions</em>.</p>
<p>Things are bad, sure. But they used to be so much worse.</p>

			 <p>Time for Apple to introduce the <em>Pro</em> moniker for top-end iPhones. They&rsquo;re no longer what most people need and have become about more than just <em>what people want</em>, whilst the lower end devices are great. I think this would help reduce people&rsquo;s perception that it costs too much.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/180811/p2#a180811p2">The sky is falling on Twitter</a>. Maybe. Probably. Nobody knows for sure but we do know one thing: giants fall, especially on the web.</p>
<p>With that in mind people who at one point or another waved a flag for Twitter and <em>social media</em> in general are beginning to think back to when the web seemed less scattered and fragile, even if it wasn&rsquo;t actually, and remembering that blogging <strong>is a thing!</strong> Yes, it still exists, and lots of people do it, <em>and</em> they do it well!</p>
<p>As the shock of that idea settles in your mind and you <a href="http://micro.welltempered.net/2018/04/10/a-guide-to.html">take a look at Micro.blog</a> let&rsquo;s also talk about where the platform is lacking, specifically with mainstream social web users in mind &ndash; basically, you&rsquo;re looking to spend less of your time in Twitter, Facebook, whatever, and want to actually replace it with something &ndash; and a little about how improvements can be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost
<ul>
<li>Paying for a social network platform is considered a non-starter, especially for people who want you to know that. The truth is that Micro.blog is free, however posting is built with blogs in mind &ndash; the name says it all! &ndash; and blogs need hosting to exist, which in turn costs money to provide.</li>
<li>A possible way to improve this is finding a way to offer a free version; perhaps with limitations attached, such as <em>X amount of posts per X amount of time</em>.</li>
<li>It is true that you can grab a free blog from WordPress, plug the feed for that into Micro.blog and that will be your posting for free on top of the free features you get with Micro.blog itself. Obviously this is not as streamlined as having all-in with Micro.blog but it is at least an option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moderation
<ul>
<li>The age of mainstream social media has seen the rise of an inevitable fact: people must be given the ability to protect themselves on the web. Whilst there are generally agreed upon ideas centred around account security, it is also crucial for individuals to have control over the availability of their contributions to a platform.</li>
<li>Whilst it is true that the open web offers a greater chance of exposure in return for greater freedom, the fact is Micro.blog is not a wild thing in the web but instead a platform owned and run by the people who develop it; this involves manual curation, a process the Micro.blog team have in fact touted in favour of an algorithmic approach and so if anything they have gone out of their way to <em>not</em> make any room for bad excuses should anything go wrong.</li>
<li>Saying that, the platform lacks all but a newly released <em>Mute</em> feature that both only works for people and is the only tool available to as many people as possible; the other tool, reporting people, is only available on the Mac app. These limitations are particularly glaring in light of Twitter&rsquo;s fairly robust user-side toolset, long overdue thought it might have been.</li>
<li>The ability to block people, an expansion of the reporting and mute tools, and a continuation of the already established broadcast from the Micro.blog team regarding these issues would all make for significant improvements to the current system. It should also be noted that the Micro.blog team are open to discussions about this and related issues, to the extent that of the two full-time developers one is the community manager.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Metrics
<ul>
<li>You can get valuable feedback from following counts and the like, whether that&rsquo;s for personal use or if you&rsquo;re using social media for work &ndash; the lines between personal and work often blur on social media, especially for power users and so they will often make loud calls for the importance of metrics.</li>
<li>Micro.blog already has <em>some</em> metric-based implementation within the platform but it is much less obvious and does not follow the broadly accepted design of the closed web platforms.</li>
<li>The next step in this process could involve implementing the most in-demand metrics but pair that with an option to switch it off or opt-out for those who are not interested in either side of this data; robust support for anonymity is important not just for usability (having options makes better quality platforms) but also for the integrity of user safety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discovery
<ul>
<li>There is no search, no hashtags, no Trending, no Moments&hellip; the values of the establishment have very much failed to land on Micro.blog when it comes to finding people.</li>
<li>Micro.blog does come with a <em>Discover</em> timeline, tagmoji (basically, tagging posts using emoji), and a behaviour driven approach called &lsquo;Micro Monday&rsquo; which is a well-considered version of Follow Friday and an accompanying podcast by the same name.</li>
<li>Whilst search and tagging can be used to manipulate a platform and thus spoil it, as we have plainly seen across lots of social media platforms, an implementation of them with as much care and consideration of the rest of Micro.blog would be a significant improvement for Discovery. Perhaps these features would be only available for Verified users (to verify yourself on Micro.blog involves either a paid account or enough effort for free users as to discourage malicious users).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apps
<ul>
<li>On the side of people using Apple products Micro.blog is well served, with a first-party (official) app on both iOS and the Mac; on top of that there are two first-party apps for the photo and podcast side of Micro.blog. Unfortunately people using Android and Windows are left with no first-party support outside of the web.</li>
<li>Whilst social media has become an ecosystem of first-party apps, Micro.blog is built on the open web and as such includes a culture of embracing third-party developers. Not only is there an existing third-party client on iOS with enthusiastic backing from the Micro.blog team, there are now also two options on Android also backed by the Micro.blog team.
<ul>
<li>Best of all, the Micro.blog developers make themselves available for helping the third-party developers in a way that is much more flexible and open to fast improvements when compared to the behemoth companies of the closed web.</li>
<li>Unfortunately Android continues to be difficult for development, as is the case for most platforms and services, whilst there has been nothing save for vague comments about any sort of Windows app.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is clear app development will continue to be a process dependent on other factors in a bigger way than the other issues, mostly with regard to the need for more people to be on the platform. In the meantime the best way to counter these issues is to make the web the absolute core of Micro.blog; by making the web app the prime version of Micro.blog it makes the platform accessible to as many people as possible as well as providing a robust back-up for times when access via app is difficult.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These appear to be the flagpole issues surrounding the idea of Micro.blog as at least some sort of alternative to Twitter and mainstream social media platforms. It is still entirely true that Micro.blog does <em>not</em> exist to replace these platforms for every single person, nor is it likely to ever be that.</p>
<p>However, the more these issues are tackled the more likely people will find Micro.blog to be a viable alternative for exactly that which many people have already embraced it; a place for thoughtful, considerate posting with space for lots of ideas, discussions, <em>and</em> more than supportive of the quick-post culture that initially pushed Twitter into the mainstream of web culture.</p>

			 <p>A lot of <a href="https://micro.blog/ft/833073">the ideas in this thread</a> are almost identical to what the closed web monoliths have been doing for some time, and continue to do so today. As such I think they&rsquo;re best mostly left to third parties (via apps available on <strong>various vendors</strong>), whilst the first party MB experience should tread carefully &ndash; I&rsquo;m not saying it should lack features but I believe avoiding bloat ought to be one of the top priorities to maintain it as the core of the platform.</p>
<p>I truly believe the best version of the first-party Micro.blog experience is as the <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/86">Naked Robotic Core</a>. Either that or we&rsquo;ll one day be met with <em>Micro.blog Moments</em> and <em>Faves From Somebody You Follow</em> filling up our timelines, rendering this entire enterprise a big waste of time.</p>

			 <p>&hellip; because why else do I have a blog.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/simonwoods/813631">I replied</a> to Cheri Baker&rsquo;s <a href="http://social.cheribaker.com/2018/08/20/its-been-interesting.html">excellent post</a> and inevitably wrote far too much for a comment:</p>
<p>Sure you find out about other people online, even get to know them to varying degrees but the most substantial, most humane connections do not occur via proxy.</p>
<p>As such my question is: is it worth constantly trying these variations on an idea and throwing them out, if one is already doing the best version of the limited task for which it is needed? I&rsquo;m not sure leaving Twitter entirely makes much of a difference if you just throw your whole lot in with something else, assuming you&rsquo;re looking to make at least some part of yourself available to the wider world; rather, keep something like Twitter in its place, compartmentalised and use something else for the most substantial effort with your online contributions&hellip; say, a blog, or even simply using a platform offering something <em>different</em>.</p>
<p>At some point soon I <em>need</em> to make some firm decisions about all of this stuff, not least because it is such a drain of energy and time neither of which I have much of to begin with. As time passes I believe pragmatism will win out:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, and always first, what do <em>you</em> want from your time on the web.
<ul>
<li>Whilst peer pressue is a fun thing, this is your life to maintain no matter how much you choose to share it with others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To what degree do your most idealistic thoughts do more damage to your goals if you follow them strictly to the letter.
<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s not forget that it is both OK and entirely healthy to actually <em>change your thinking</em> on, well, most issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at that second one in particular, since so much of Twitter is often guided by people&rsquo;s different contributions to the collective culture and that is at least influenced by how we feel about the world and how it works.</p>
<p>Even if you stay in the same general area (ideologically speaking), your thoughts can change to something no longer befitting of those upon which you chose to take your particular stand. And all of this time, and this energy, to decide about the thing&hellip; the trappings of the things&hellip; without truly actually doing <em>the thing</em>!</p>
<p>There is no doubting the influence of these closed networks, obviously, but if they become more than just the means to your goals I am not confident we are using them as the tool they ought to be. The approach feels so confused; the tool, Twitter, ought not be the focus of our efforts <em>especially</em> when the worst actors within our communities simply could not care less about this angle &ndash; they are too busy using it to their ends!</p>
<p>Perhaps it is time to simply step back, take a deep breath, put Twitter into the compartment within which we can maintain its usefulness as tool &ndash; rather than, say, <em>as public consciousness</em> &ndash; and turn our most intense efforts towards the issues <strong>underlying</strong> that which many people currently agree to be the most urgent problem.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes I end up <a href="https://micro.blog/simonwoods/807258">creating a thread using the Micro.blog Conversation view</a> and I actually did so intentionally.</p>
<p>There is great flexibility within this system, and even though it would be great if everything was easily explained let&rsquo;s not forget the idea that Facebook/Twitter are &ldquo;simple and easy&rdquo; is in fact a big pile of bullshit. As such, when it comes to comparisons I would say there is more to it than <em>feature vs. feature</em>; there is in fact a larger conversation to be had about how we use the web, how we live on it, and what it is we should expect from other people.</p>
<p>I know such large topics are not normally covered on a &ldquo;social media site&rdquo;, with all of the nuance inherit therein, but maybe it is time to reconsider this idea and just choose a better platform.</p>
<p>Maybe it is time to make yourself uncomfortable, place greater value on your time spent on the web, and find that <em>thinking differently</em> is possible outside of the corporate social web.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://simonmumbles.micro.blog/2018/08/10/summer-update.html">Three days ago I posted about my return to blogging</a>. Today I have returned to Micro.blog in a substantial way; I&rsquo;m back on my hosted blog and more than that, <em>this blog is now in fact my website</em>. I do not currently have my domain name &ndash; that&rsquo;ll happen later, since the tight budget continues to exist &ndash; but this is now my personal full site on the web. I&rsquo;ll talk more about this soon but for now, here are the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Considered Haste &ndash; the previous version of my website &ndash; has now merged into this site.
<ul>
<li>The name <em>Mumblings</em> remains.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now page is updated.</li>
<li>Feeds page has been added.</li>
<li>Considered Haste archive imported.
<ul>
<li>sorry for any duplicate posts; they should be far back, though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most recent Mumblings&rsquo; posts imported from WordPress.</li>
<li>Uh&hellip; that&rsquo;s it!
<ul>
<li>honestly, the Now pages covers some stuff</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to posting some more about what&rsquo;s happening here within the context of Micro.blog in general. Despite not having access to regular posting, I have very much been reading and seeing the continued progress of Micro.blog and, uh, latest events in the Closed Web.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to be back. ‚úåÔ∏è</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->About a month ago<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†I moved my main site to a WordPress Hosted site and cancelled my Micro.blog plans.

			 <p>Over the past month I&rsquo;ve learned yet another lesson in just how fragile momentum can be, especially when it is put under the strain of anxiety and the often chaotic nature of people in groups. Basically: fuck guns, fuck immoral politicians and their supporters, and fuck this shitty heatwave.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my recent mental foray into the social web<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was followed by three weeks of decision making I am finally comfortable enough to consider stable&hellip; well, about as stable as you can get when it comes to the world of the web. With that in mind I have a few new profiles up and running:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reconsidering Instagram and Facebook, specifically wihin the context of a simple realisation: protesting the world by leaving it is not necessarily the most effective strategy to take.</p>
<p>Yes, I know for plenty of people you are not &ldquo;leaving the world&rdquo; or any such thing if you do not happen to use popular web platforms. But it is, in some part, true <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Even if, in the future, I reduce my usage to basic status updates and linking only to that which I post elsewhere.</p>
<p>Consider this: not everybody lives the life you live, neither do you live theirs, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that is perfectly OK<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Anyway I have not returned to Facebook. Given the chance I will not be doing so, though I am far less willing to fight against that if it turns out I would be more effective at reaching my goals by returning to that place.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have also applied a few updates to my two blog-based sites (this site and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mumblings<!-- raw HTML omitted -->):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(Info about Mumblings can be found over there.)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now. See you soon. :)</p>

			 <p>There is no doubt that the siloed, social web has been revealed for the limiting, sometimes destructive force it can be; the question is: why has it been so destructive?</p>
<p>One part of the answer might be to do with the open web and its apparent lack of signalling, specifically to the wider web-using public, the ease with which people can escape the siloes even if momentarily. When people are offered superior alternatives &ndash; what you might consider <!-- raw HTML omitted -->competition<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; there is at least a much greater possibility those alternatives will be able to exist, thus enabling the chance for higher quality, substantive contributions to be made to the web as a whole. The important part here is that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->people are offered the alternative<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Not just enthusiasts, or enterprise clients, or niche vendors; rather, the average everyday web user. Even as an enthusiast and (relatively) longtime user of the web I find it hard to say that the open web has met some of its potential by surfacing the alternative.</p>
<p>The wave of apparently-shocking incidents involving the siloed web has, however, prompted action where before there was either little or just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->too<!-- raw HTML omitted --> little; substantial figures in influential web communities are putting their resources where their mouths are and genuinely prodding at alternatives to what some people consider <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Internet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (aka the Facebook news feed). Some are even pushing forward with ambitious plans to create much-needed competition.</p>
<p>With that idea in mind we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->now have Micro.blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is awesome.</p>
<p>The applicance of a layer running between the open web and people&rsquo;s desire to make the web personal is a brilliant move, especially with the focus on blogs and the idea that even the siloed social web is something to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plugged into<!-- raw HTML omitted --> rather than swept away in a destructive manner.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Manton Reece<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and his team have gradually and carefully begun piecing together a platform that can satisfy a number of different people in different ways, without approaching the idea that the only way to provide people with the opportunity to partake in the web is to control them entirely.</p>
<p>Micro.blog works as a mixture of blog feeds, blog hosting, and comments. It&rsquo;s social media but you own your stuff and you do not have to tolerate ads, curated timelines, and a limited selection of limited apps.</p>
<p>These are two sources of information and help:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The following are other introductory posts for more information:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There is more out there and it&rsquo;s not to difficult to find once you start looking, however the Micro.blog community is constantly attempting to make it easier to get involved and get on with doing your thing. In the spirit of this activity &ndash; and all activity from the community which is in fact one of the biggest reasons to join Micro.blog at all &ndash; I am today announcing the effort with which I will attempt to help as much as possible&hellip;</p>
<p>I am launching <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Today I Learned<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a Micro.blog project for&hellip; well, Micro.blog. Through this I will provide hints, tips, links, and more with which anybody can use to become comfortable with Micro.blog. All of the relevant links are:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Micro.blog has played a big part of the past 8 months of my life, an inspiration for many things and most importantly the gateway to a wonderful community within which it is possible to find solace from the world of social media and 24 hour news. The good parts of the internet are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> dying and it is no small part due to projects such as Micro.blog. With @til I only hope I can help make it even easier for people to also find their way to such a good place.</p>
<p>Now there is work to be done, more words to be written, and more Micro.blogging to be microblogged. With that I bid you adieu and&hellip;</p>
<p>Welcome to Micro.blog!</p>

			 <p>I have big news! Claire has been discharged from both the physio and occupational therapist whom she was seeing because of wrist problems. That&rsquo;s a reduction of two frequent appointments at once. üí™</p>
<p>The kitties have been on the loose! Over the past week both of the girls have finally been allowed outside of the house, having spent two and half months establishing their base and getting vaccinations and medication to prepare their bodies.</p>
<p>Yes, that is correct: their bodies are literally ready. More pictures soon!</p>
<p>Avataaaaarrrr! (no, not that terrible film) My profile photo has changed, both on Micro.blog and everywhere else I maintain an avatar. It&rsquo;s literally actually me, so there!</p>
<p>Speaking of avatars and social accounts, it&rsquo;s fair to say that my viewpoint continues to literally always change, although I hope <a href="https://swoods.net/2018/06/where-people-are/">this post is part of a path</a> whereupon I can just make my mind up and pretty much stick to an approach.</p>
<p>Actual writing for my blog will return proper after some annoying admin stuff has been completed, including a big pile of paperwork for sorting and finally going through our calendars to get them fully set up with everything we have planned <em>and</em> to better reflect the reality of how we spend our time</p>
<p>I am in contact with a local gym which looks promising, not least because of how approachable they have been via email; I am convinced more than ever that regular exercise will be a catalyst for genuinely making progress with regard to work productivity. At the very least I know I will be healthier and feel better, which is the most important thing either way.</p>
<p>Speaking of productivity, I have settled on some non-browser based tools for getting work done on my various projects; this is part of an experiment in which I seek to find the benefits, if they exist, in limiting my use primarily of Chrome but also of browsers in general.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s uh, been a busy month since my last update, including a decent amount of progress behind the scenes with regard to various projects&hellip;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t actually realise that until I started writing this post. It feels good to be surprised by progress. üòä</p>

			 <p>Welcome to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Considered Haste<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, version 2 of swoods.net.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs start with the¬†changes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>¬†</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been quite pleased with the launch of this site, from November to now, specifically in its role as the stable presence of my online identity. Owning my identity via my own domain and investigating the IndieWeb has been a huge relief to the idea of depending on the big social media sites and the Closed Web, thanks in no small part to my account on Micro.blog. I recently <!-- raw HTML omitted -->settled my hosted blog on there as separate from this site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but it is no less mine; Manton Reece and co. are quite insistent on avoiding simply replacing the Closed Web with another closed environment and I couldn&rsquo;t be more grateful for their work.</p>
<p>This was my plan all along, although the recent stretch of inactivity on this site was unexpected (fortunately it was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thanks to good news<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) but Micro.blog has provided an antidote to the hole of stress that is moving, having become a respite and source of inspiration for the past two months. As such, it remains as my personal blog and social feed, and regular activity continues over there.</p>
<p>I have more to come with this site, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->especially writing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and progress reports on new projects all of which are at least well into the planning stage; I am excited by each one and looking forward to rolling them out. In the meantime I am making sure the aforementioned changes have settled well, specifically those centred around IndieWeb improvements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank a few people:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>¬†</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now. Bye!</p>

			 <p>Over the past few months I have become more serious about maintaining my own site, with my own domain (my name, even), and putting in a concerted effort to both care about and work on what I do on the web. Essentially, I have been trying to care more. That started in November and hits the newest milestone today.</p>
<p>This, my hosted Micro.blog, will now be home to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typical microblog posts; status updates, photos, links, etc.</li>
<li>Longer posts in a journal style.</li>
<li>Thoughts about, and questions for the Micro.blog community.</li>
<li>Experiments that have yet to find a home, be it on my main site or elsewhere.</li>
<li>Kitty updates!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to have established this new arrangement, having gradually settled into it over the past couple of months; all of February, March, and most of April have been eaten up by moving home and in that time Micro.blog was enough of a writing retreat to help me find relief from the variety of stress that comes with moving.</p>
<p>I have shifted much of the list above from my main site to here, coinciding with better establishing exactly for what I&rsquo;ll be using my main site. This has happened at the same time as archiving my Twitter account for the second time since November, my broader thoughts about which I&rsquo;ll be writing about soon but in the meantime I had <a href="https://swoods.net/2018/04/09/jacks-clusterfuck-sandwich.html">this</a> and then <a href="https://swoods.net/2018/04/12/why-i-dont.html">this</a> to say about it. I have now deactivated my account and will no longer attempt to use Twitter within a personal context.</p>
<p>When it comes to Micro.blog I have;</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed my username to my full real name.</li>
<li>Updated my About page, which is now quite long.</li>
<li>Created a Now page much like the one on my main site, only made for personal information.</li>
<li>Created a third page called Monday, a live archive of my Micro Monday recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I am now using the recently released <a href="https://preview-marfa.micro.blog/">Marfa theme</a>, and have made edits thanks to help from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marcelo Marfil &ndash; <a href="https://mmarfil.com/2018/04/14/status-105634/">the author</a>
<ul>
<li>The theme is used by Marcelo <a href="https://mmarfil.com/">on his own site</a> which itself is worth following. He has also <a href="https://github.com/mmarfil/marfa">made it available on GitHub</a> and is <a href="https://micro.blog/mmarfil">active on Micro.blog</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Roel Willems &ndash; <a href="http://roelwillems.com/">the contributor</a>
<ul>
<li>The theme was quickly enhanced by <a href="http://roelwillems.com/2018/04/15/i-switched-my.html">a guide that Roel wrote</a>, as part of <a href="http://roelwillems.com/micro-guides/">his Micro guides collection</a>. He has also <a href="https://micro.blog/roelwillems/485384">made himself available for further help</a> as part of <a href="https://micro.blog/roelwillems">his contributions to the Micro.blog community</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Manton &ndash; <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/04/6686.html">the provider</a>
<ul>
<li>The theme would not be so easily available were it not for Manton&rsquo;s continued work in updating Micro.blog with improvements, bug fixes, and everything in between. <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/05/one-year-of-micro-blog.html">A year of Micro.blog</a> underscores this fact, and <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/05/instagram-import-in-micro-blog.html">year two is off to a great start</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank all of the people involved for making it possible to use this theme in such a way as I have.</p>
<p>Discovering Micro.blog, especially with regard to the community, has become a great moment in my online life and I&rsquo;m so very happy to have settled a branch of that life with Mumblings. I look forward to spending even more of my time here and that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without all of you, you magnificent early adopters.</p>
<p>Welcome to Mumblings, my personal every-day blog. :)</p>

<p>&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rajiv Abraham doesn‚Äôt want to see the toxicity of the Closed Web spill into the Open Web<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>This is a valid concern and should certainly be on the mind of both the community as a whole <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> those who make the software upon which blogging lives.</p>
<p>However, the Open Web and especially the blog-based sections of it already have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->years<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of experience in dealing with these problems; a good example is the aforementioned Micro.blog, as an alternative to a commenting system is quite brilliant in its elegance &ndash; now as individuals we do not have to manage the comments on our site, whilst those who are either writing for a site in a group or employed to do so can either choose to manage the comments or not&hellip; or even better, turn to something like Micro.blog where the comments are a lot less likely to be poisonous from the get-go.</p>
<p>Of course this is also dependent on the development of platforms like Micro.blog; it could go either way. The point here is that we all know more now than we ever did and it is upon those of us who care to actually go to the effort to have community standards, including codes of conduct and active moderating where it is needed.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the vitriol from which the big Closed Web media companies have been profiting is a different kind of beast from what we once so naively referred to as ‚ÄúInternet Drama‚Äù, and we should be vigilant lest it spreads entirely across the web but we have hope like never before be it from the experienced crowd of web users, the bright new minds of so-called digital natives, or those of us who have adapted to the ever growing blend of physical and digital. We are determined to not so easily lose this world before it has barely begun, certainly not to the likes of those who clearly care not for the people who have built their success whether that‚Äôs Mark or Jack, and most certainly not to the people who use their work to wreak havoc in our lives.</p>
<p>We <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can<!-- raw HTML omitted --> do better. And I think we will.</p>

			 <p>I recently <a href="http://micro.swoods.net/2018/04/09/jacks-clusterfuck-sandwich.html">talked about my discontent with Twitter</a>, having been on-and-off again with the whole thing for years. Not only has that feeling intensified since joining Micro.blog a few months ago but it has in fact thoroughly swung into the <em>off</em> part of the cycle, which has happened before now only I did not have the same stable set-up that is now available to me when it comes to my own site and other blogging.</p>
<p>I have more to say about exactly what it is that I am doing but now is not the time for it. Instead, this is why I&rsquo;m leaving my Twitter account as an archive and withdrawing entirely from it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Incompetent product development: leaders who are either unwilling or incapable of curtailing the foul parts of their service, from abuse through to soulless spam and the intersection therein.</li>
<li>Hostile product development: a first-party environment that is all about using you up for advertisers with very little reward.</li>
<li>Inferior product: the alternative, whether via IndieWeb initiatives and ideas built with open standards in mind (such as Micro.blog) or simply using RSS readers for consumption and email for feedback, are made with the idea that using the web is a <strong>good</strong> thing and should <strong>not</strong> be punitive.</li>
</ol>
<p>As such I&rsquo;ll be here, with updates and all sorts of other activity forthcoming.</p>
<p>Goodbye Twitter, and hello Micro.blog. üëã</p>

			 <p>If my preferred Twitter client on Android (Flamingo) is made worse by the continued work of Jack and co. then I&rsquo;ll be left hoping for, ironically, my RSS reader (Readably) to carry the activity of people who I like and only use Twitter for microblogging.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s only thanks to Feedbin whose work with Twitter integration has rightfully been praised.</p>
<p>Swimming in the waters of Micro.blog have spoiled me; not only does the work of Manton and co. integrate well with the open web (one of their stated goals) but they are not philisophically opposed to high standards in a desparate rush to clone <em>Facebook</em> of all fucking things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for me to take the hint and wind down my Twitter use to the point of nil, instead spending this type of energy on both reading the open web and fine-tuning my experience therein.</p>
<p>Congratulations Jack, Jack&rsquo;s co-workers, and the Twitter users comfortable with eating shit; your contributions to the mediocrity that defines so much of this world are only increasing over time. üëç</p>

			 <p>The past few weeks have been, uh, interesting. As I mentioned in the last post on my site it&rsquo;s been a period of Big Change personally and it&rsquo;s safe to say that I&rsquo;m learning about how the significance of such changes only increases with time. The move was&hellip; OK. Not perfect or even good in some ways but it could have been worse; we survived, which is important! However, I have a list of improvements for myself no matter how far into the future the next move will be.</p>
<p>This blog, my site, and even my Micro.blog account took a hit with regard to activity and even without the internet my writing has been non-existent. It&rsquo;s been weird. Even writing this in a completely different building but on the same computer is unusual; for reference, this is the very first set of words I have typed since the last post on my site (or my last Micro.blog post, whichever was last) so even an unusual length of time has passed, at least by my 2018 standard.</p>
<p>The slow period is now over, thanks both to the relatively quick turnover by the Unpacking Committee (myself, Claire, and our two altogether <em>loud</em> cats) and the eventual activation of our broadband service. I continue to possess the notes for ideas previously considered worth noting and will doubtless be inspired to write in light of the move and its variety of consequences &ndash; for example: wow, is having a loft a fucking relief.</p>
<p>Anyway it feels good to have got this off my chest. Not only does it feel good to be writing again but I can&rsquo;t wait to catch up on my web reading and the great community on Micro.blog.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m tired more often and I&rsquo;m getting more work done. This makes sense but seriously: fuck time.

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve definitely hit a wall with this, where no amount of extra effort applied gets me closer to my goals. So, it&rsquo;s time to apply some smarter work. I&rsquo;m going to schedule work sessions at the beginning and end of every day, when I&rsquo;m most likely to have full free time, and honestly when I feel high levels of motivation; maybe proximity to sleep is the key ingredient here. That will be helped by a dose of automation, specifically with the tech that I&rsquo;m using; it&rsquo;s taken a long time but I&rsquo;m finally settled on a structure for the various pieces of software I use to stay organised, so now it&rsquo;s time to set up some automated processes for them to run through.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overall I&rsquo;m happy with this approach. It&rsquo;s a lot simpler than various previous efforts.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As far as the blog goes, there will be two new regular additions:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Post A Day<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That&rsquo;s one guaranteed post each day. Will likely be mostly nonsense but we&rsquo;ll see how it goes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Selfie A Day
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yep, I&rsquo;m finally giving into the whole selfie thing. Basically, I <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->need<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to lose weight and have lost patience with previous attempts to do so; it&rsquo;s time for the public shame route.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->These will be taken on and posted to Instagram, with a basic cross-post to here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So uh yeah. Change is good.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>(<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Second Note:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†Those two planned additions are still happening, in some way, but not necessarily in such a weird-fake-branding way.

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m sitting here, in a university class room, and despite the irrefutable quality of the subject and following discourse I just&hellip; I feel tired.

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why? I dunno. Could it be stress? There are medical reasons for my tiredness but I don&rsquo;t know what they are right now. I know one for sure, though, and it&rsquo;s that if I am confronted by activity of others for mentally draining exercises then my body just feels the need to sleep. It is more likely to happen with something that I am not involved, to the point where I am fairly confident there is a strong correlation between level of involvement and likelihood of sleep.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s a mess, really, but I have at least discovered one thing; feeling discomfort helps. I feel both actually awake and a desire to <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> something. Now that&rsquo;s motivation for me. The funny thing is that it is <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->physical<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> discomfort that has sparked this motivation.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m fairly sure if there is non-physical discomfort that I&rsquo;d just feel a wave of tiredness.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>What makes something worth our attention? A lot of money is invested in answering this question, in all of its various guises&hellip; a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lot<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of money. As such the assumption is that the question has value and whilst that is likely true the fact is that it is much more interesting to consider a different, albeit similar question: what makes something interesting?</p>
<p>As is often the case, the quality of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interesting<!-- raw HTML omitted --> being subjective makes it difficult to explore and therefore less popular in our world of interconnected musing and opining; there is no doubt about it, we vote with our eyeballs and the numbers on vague notions such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interesting<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are not good. Instead, let&rsquo;s have a list of The 7 Most Fascinating Things For 2017!</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay. I mean, who has the time, right? Well, the fact is that the modern world of internet-centred living is simply too large for anybody to keep on top of; the idea of being <!-- raw HTML omitted -->up to date<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†in the year 2017 is altogether ridiculous. Instead, the gems of the internet can be found if we instead choose to focus on whatever thing we care about in the moment and invest time in that above all others.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t easy and never has been, however, now in the age of data perhaps we can find it that much easier to see both approaches to living and thus gaining the perspective that is crucial to discovering exactly what it is that we care about&hellip; what it is that we find interesting.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is a part of that in me and whilst this is a terrible example of excusing my laziness, I still feel okay about publishing this.

<p>¬†</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>¬†</p>
<p>This is in fact the first thing I have written in Writer whilst offline, or at least the first time in which I did not have access to the internet by necessity rather than choice. If that doesn&rsquo;t speak to how lazy my current decision making for subjects is then nothing ever will.</p>
<p>Either way, here I am without even the ability to become distracted by such delights as social media or email or&hellip; well, just about anything. It is odd to say the least but I am definitely enjoying it; this makes me think that it is therefore perhaps time to use software to restrict my access to such distractions &ndash; there is certainly not shortage of options for that.</p>
<p>On previous occasions I have been relieved to have purchased the lifetime version of Writer and today is no different; in fact, it is a lifesaver. To have a reliable text editor with such flexibility as to be at home both offline and online has given me a direct line to feeling altogether less useless during this day. For better context, let&rsquo;s talk about the computer I am using.</p>
<p>The Chromebook I am currently using is the first small laptop I have ever used of the modern generation; it leaves the short-lived &ldquo;netbook&rdquo; category from a decade ago looking like the cheap con that it undoubtedly was, such is the quality I find throughout. Even the browser-based OS outshines the so-called desktop-class machines in a shameful spot.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, it&rsquo;s fair to say that it is down to the software to do most of the talking with this machine; the hardware is little more than a thin case through which you interact with the apps built for Google&rsquo;s own OS. From this point, Writer shines, delivering me everything I need for what I am doing right now whilst not getting in my way; it might be seem like an obvious required function for a text editor but when you consider that Writer is primarily <!-- raw HTML omitted -->made for a browser<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the app&rsquo;s robust performance is startling for those of us with longer memories.</p>
<p>Despite my meandering into the realm of notebooks, Chromebooks, and my old age the fact remains that Writer has done exactly what I need, when I need, and I could not be happier as a lifetime customer.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Thanks John Watson, like a man in a blue box you&rsquo;ve given me time where none existed before.</p>

(via <a href="http://cole007.net/blog/158/the-problem-with-corbynism">The problem with Corybynism</a>)</p>
<p>The lack of civility in British civics is perhaps the most glaring symptom of a society that is fractured. This is the underlying problem; we can&rsquo;t even begin to work together to maintain and improve vital public services (thus better securing the lives of our most vulnerable citizens) if we can&rsquo;t even agree to simply <em>talk</em> to one another.</p>

<p>In some ways this is freeing but there are things I am missing that I can only access with the phone.</p>

<p>Earlier today I archived my tumblr, not for the first time.</p>
<p>Also been actively working to use non-social media feeds for news, info, and the like.</p>
