<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about tech or media, but if a tech oligarch was helping to systematically dismantle the federal government using his own sequestered private sector employees, I might not, personally, report on it by primarily posting to the social media platform that he himself owns.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m gonna hop off Micro.blog for a bit. Need to put my thoughts and feelings together <em>away</em> from the space that is inciting them, mostly in a bad way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to post a thank-you note for many who have spoken up, and then I&rsquo;ll be gone for a few days.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to chat, <a href="https://swoods.net/hello/">I am available</a>.</p>

			 <p>I felt so good about my work for TIL, and therefore Micro.blog itself (my work is unofficial and, other than being supplied with complimentary hosting I am unpaid) – and now I just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Unconvinced that spark of community can be recovered. It feels as if the only shoe has dropped.</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;re playing some games tonight! Our usual D&amp;D session is on hold since we don&rsquo;t have a full table until next week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go prep for that, and get back to work on emails and posts about Micro.blog either tonight or in the morning.</p>
